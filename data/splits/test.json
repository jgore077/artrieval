    "images/TADDEO DI BARTOLO/Allegories and Figures from Roman History.jpg": "On one wall, shown in this picture,  Taddeo painted allegories of Justice and Magnanimity under the two arches; beneath each he placed a figure from Roman history exemplifying the concept. Below Justice (at left) there are Cicero, M. Porcius Cato, and P. Scipio Nasica; below Magnanimity (at right) Each group  of Roman heroes is labeled with an inscription in Latin, and each figure bears a further Latin Inscription below his feet.",
    "images/FRANCIA, Francesco/Adoration of the Child (1).jpg": "On the left we see the adoration of the Child. On the right, the pictorial story continues with a subtle evocation of an allegorical subject fairly rare at the time: St Augustine hesitating between the blood of Christ and the Virgin's milk.",
    "images/GALEOTTI, Sebastiano/Ceiling decoration.jpg": "The picture shows the fresco of the vault of the central nave of the church representing the Eternal Wisdom between the Misericordia and the Justice and the triumph of the virtues on the vices.",
    "images/BEECKMAN, Andries/The Castle of Batavia, Seen from Kali Besar West.jpg": "A man strolls with a woman whose clothing and appearance strongly suggest an Asian ancestry, while a servant holds a payung (parasol, symbol of status in Southeast Asia) above them. In the background of the painting is the castle of Batavia, the bastion of Dutch rule in Asia. The governor-general is just arriving in town with his retinue. In the foreground is a market by the Kali Besar, or Great River.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/St John the Baptist (1).jpg": "The impressive image of the young Baptist, of an evocative power that in this case also one might call pre-Baroque, emerges from a dark grey background in which one glimpses the slightly pinkish rockface of a grotto. The athletic figure, the animal skin and the cloak are thrown into relief by a dramatic light that still illumines wonderful pictorial effects visible in the better preserved parts, such as the cross made of cane in the lower corner.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Lunette and Popes.jpg": "Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images (painted in the Quattrocento) of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Apollo Guarding the Herds of Admetus.jpg": "This composition consists of two masses of trees and an Etruscan town all rising like blocks from a composition primarily planned on the horizontal plane.",
    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries.jpg": "The village was famous for its fortified cathedral, built like a ship, the curious design of the thatched roofs of its cottages, and its fishing fleet. But the novel opportunities of the place were the sea and the colourful boats. The motif of small boats drawn up on the beach also occurs in the work of Monet in the 1880s.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/St Humility and Scenes from her Life.jpg": "It is a hagiographic icon, a style of reredos in use until the thirteenth century which featured an image showing a full-length portrait of a saint or the Virgin Mary surrounded by a frame illustrating the stories of the featured person. St Humility (Umiltà in Italian) is pictured wearing the habit of her religious order, holding a book and a palm leaf, a symbol of glory; her head is covered with sheepskin, an emblem of humility and an iconographic characteristic typical of St Humility. At the bottom left a woman is knelt in prayer, most likely representing the customer who commissioned the work. The lively narrative of the scenes, set in architectural environments and landscapes which abound with realistic details, is clear and informative, reiterating the educational purpose that images played in an era when literacy was a skill known only to the few.",

On the table is a luxurious breakfast presented with expensive tableware. The objects on the table are not arranged as an integrated composition, but just set next to each other without any formal structure, so that the whole gives an impression of multicoloured variety.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Allegory of Gluttony and Lust.jpg": "Gluttony is personified by the swimmers at the upper left who have gathered around a large wine barrel straddled by a pot-bellied peasant. Another man swims closer to shore, his vision obscured by the meat pie balanced on his head. This scene is followed, on the right, by a pair of lovers in a tent, another motif reminiscent of the Lust scene in the Prado \"Tabletop\".",

    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) (8).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the central panel, representing the Bridal Chamber in Semen Capsule (after Fraenger). Various aspects of the deadly sin Lust are acted out in a forthright fashion, for example, by the couple enclosed in a bubble at the lower left, other figures seem to display perverted acts of love, such as the man plunged head first into the water and shielding his privy parts with his hands.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/Deposition of Christ.jpg": "To accompany the original altarpiece, Bronzino painted side panels depicting John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence) on the left and St Cosmas (a patron saint of the Medici family and Cosimo's name-saint) on the right. The picture shows the original version of the painting.",

    "images/GÉRICAULT, Théodore/The Raft of the Medusa.jpg": "The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in a painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be.",

    "images/DYCK, Sir Anthony van/Marchesa Elena Grimaldi Cattaneo.jpg": "The Genoese noblewoman is shown on the terrace of her palace. The soaring columns and cloud-swept sky add a sense of height and dignity to the majestic figure, while the brilliant red parasol relieves the otherwise somber colour scheme.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Two Men Contemplating the Moon.jpg": "The moon, an old Christian sign of hope, gleams from behind a withered tree, watched by two men, perhaps the artist and a pupil, in the 'old German' costume favoured by the resistance movement during the years of Napoleonic occupation.",

    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Still-Life.jpg": "This still-life represents a vase with flowers, a coffeepot and fruit.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/The Epiphany.jpg": "This picture, which shows the Adoration of the Magi in the foreground and the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the background, belongs to a series of seven panels depicting the life of Christ. The clearly organized space, arranged like a stepped stage with the stable viewed from below, and the simplified shapes of the figures are typical of Giotto's innovative naturalism, as is the way in which the oldest king has removed his crown, knelt down, and impetuously lifted the Child from the manger.",
    "images/ALBERTI, Leon Battista/Exterior view (1).jpg": "The plan is in the shape of a Greek cross, with three identical arms centring apses, under a central cross-vaulted space without any interior partitions. The photo shows the façade in the actual state. View the ground plan of the church.",
    "images/FONTANA, Lavinia/Self-Portrait in a Studio.jpg": "The artist depicted herself in a studio, preparing to draw from figurines using metal-point and coated paper. Her opulent costume tells of her success and her noble clientele.",
    "images/ROTTENHAMMER, Hans I/Allegory of the Arts.jpg": "Pictura is inspired by her beautiful model (Venus), as Architecture devises a centrally planned château-fort; Poetry writes and Music strums the lute.",
    "images/YKENS, Frans/Pronk Still-Life.jpg": "This painting shows a large pronk still-life with flowers, fruit and fowl. Fancy pronk still-lifes feature imported fruits and expensive objects such as Chinese porcelain, Venetian glassware, and silver-gilt cups and trays, usually rendered in glistening light and a velvety atmosphere.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Apotheosis of the Pisani Family (detail).jpg": "This section shows the known continents of Asia, America, and Africa on a cloud, while Europe is portrayed above them, on a bull, to express the greater degree of civilization she was thought to possess. A battle scene appears along the lower edge of the picture and obviously refers to the subjugation of the Turks, symbolized by the two figures in long coats, who have thrown themselves down in front of the invaders.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (detail) (1).jpg": "In several horizontal picture fields, arranged parallel to each other, Dürer depicted the account in the Legenda aurea of how the Christian company of soldiers with Bishop Achatius, which had been converted to the Christian faith by a miracle, was executed on Mount Ararat. The Roman rulers Hadrian and Antoninus commissioned seven Oriental princes to carry out the execution, and they stand out here in their splendid turbans and robes.",
    "images/RIBERA, Jusepe de/St Sebastian Tended by the Holy Women.jpg": "In this large canvas, the figure of the saint lies naked on the ground, one arm still suspended from the tree of martyrdom. The holy women Irene and Lucilla tend the saint, one of them removing the arrows and the other holding the jar of ointment. Two little angels bearing the crown and the palm of martyrdom hover above them.",
    "images/BURNE-JONES, Edward/The Days of Creation The First Day.jpg": "In one panel after another, an angel comes to the fore holding a globe, rather like a large crystal ball. As for the angel at the front, each presents a scene associated with the particular day of creation: trees on the third day, for example, a flock of birds on the fifth. The scenes are to some extent mysterious, suggesting more than they show, except perhaps for the last one, of a pale and slender Eve, with a taller, darker Adam. In front of this one, a seventh angel is sitting and playing a stringed instrument - no doubt praising God for the creation.",
    "images/TORRITI, Jacopo/Frescoes in the fourth bay of the nave.jpg": "The walls on either side of the window are divided horizontally. At top, the Creation of the World can be seen on the left and the Creation of Adam (Jacopo Torriti) on the right. Below these are the Building of the Ark and the Boarding of the Ark (follower of Cimabue). On the walls of the nave we can see the first three stations in the life of St Francis. The illusionistic framework of the Legend of St Francis is also visible: the rich console frieze above the coffered ceiling, which is laid out in perspective and supported by twisted columns. The frescoes illustrate the complex decorative program realized in the nave of the Upper Church.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Last Judgment Triptych (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the left wing.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Minerva, with Two Nymphs, Diana, and Aeolus.jpg": "The picture shows the third scene on the ceiling of the main hall.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/St John the Baptist (2).jpg": "The body is delicate and the expression is dreamy, so much so as to suggest a considerable distance in time from the other two.",
    "images/CORINTH, Lovis/Self-Portrait with Skeleton.jpg": "The skeleton on its hook is plainly an anatomical model. The painter is beside it, but no relation is established between him and the skeleton.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/Martyrdom of St Sebastian.jpg": "The arrows which his tormentors are pointing at him symbolize a sudden illness.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Flora.jpg": "The beautiful woman carrying flowers is thought to be Flora, the classical goddess of flowers and spring. The sheen of her reddish golden hair, the soft hue of her skin, and the just visible breast whose bareness is skillfully emphasized by her hand and the pink brocade, display Titian's abilities as a subtle colourist and his sure feeling for sensuality.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Adoration of the Magi (detail) (7).jpg": "Beyond the wall is an imaginary city, and an open landscape filled with many figures. Ships of all sort are sailing across the water, some of them with billowing sails. From behind a wall, two simply dressed men are watching the Adoration.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/View of the interior towards the altar.jpg": "The picture shows the decoration on the north wall (to the right from the entrance).",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Madonna with Canon van der Paele (details) (1).jpg": "The exquisite brocades, furs, silks and other setails are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Visitation (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the measured and affectionate embrace between the two women, a demonstration of mutual respect. A pair of women behind them are Elisabeth's companions. Giovanna degli Albizzi is the third figure from right.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Marriage of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to Beatrice of Burgundy.jpg": "The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his wife Beatrice kneel before Gebhard, Bishop of Würzburg. On the right of the picture, the royal household and dignitaries of empire are gathered, while the father of the bride, Count Raynald of Burgundy, kneels on the steps to the left of the altar, accompanied by two pageboys. The court jester, seen from behind, occupies a prominent position in the foreground at the foot of the steps to the altar, an example of Tiepolo's penchant for introducing witty and frivolous ideas to the agreed pictorial subject matter. The steps to the altar lead us into the picture and, along with the colossal background architecture, create great spatial depth. The musicians on the balcony in the background are a favourite motif of Tiepolo, which he uses to help make the historical subject matter topical.",
    "images/NETSCHER, Caspar/Two Boys Blowing Bubbles.jpg": "The young lad in the background blows a bubble while his older playmate gazes at one floating above. Two seashells and a very ornate silver tazza (which expertly reproduces one fabricated by the renowned silversmith Adam van Vianen in 1618) lie on the ledge before the boys.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/Holy Family with St Elisabeth and the Infant St John the Baptist.jpg": "The meditative figure of Joseph is obscured in the background.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Domenico/Winter Stroll (1).jpg": "This scene is on the wall of the room with simulated Gothic architecture in the Foresteria of the Villa Valmarana. In this scene two noblewomen, wrapped in their warmest clothing, return home after a brief walk in the country accompanied by another woman who could perhaps be a maidservant.",
    "images/ANDREA DI BARTOLO/Coronation of the Virgin (1).jpg": "The four saints on the side panels are Catherine of Alexandria, Augustine, Peter, and Paul.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Last Judgment (detail) (3).jpg": "The diagonal arrangements of the angel formations lead down to the main register, whose centre - also the centre of the wall as a whole - is occupied by the judge of the world, emphasized by his size and colourful aureole. Golden rays in the interior of the aureole surround the figure of Christ; he turns to the blessed and extend his right hand to them in invitation while his left points to the damned in dismissal. A ring of angels, four blowing trumpets, surround the judge of the world like a second bright gloriole.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/St Jerome in the Desert (1).jpg": "St Jerome is portrayed in the dual role of penitent hermit in the wilderness, and humanist, intent on reading. He is sitting in a wild, desert landscape with a city in the background that signifies the contrast between nature and civilisation. A lion, hidden in its den, from whose paw Jerome is said to have removed a thorn, is keeping him company. In the foreground, a thin cross stands in the ground, while a lizard crawls behind it. The landscape, with the desert and city, may have represented hope for a return to a harmony between nature and humanity. The city that stands out in the background is imaginary, although it consists of real – albeit not Venetian - architecture: the church of San Vitale and the Mausoleum of Theodoric in Ravenna, the Bridge of Tiberius in Rimini, and the bell tower of Sant'Anastasia in Verona, all buildings that Bellini had probably been able to draw and then use in his compositions.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Scenes from the Life of St Christopher (scenes 5 and 6).jpg": "The picture shows the two scenes at the lower section of the right wall of the chapel in their present state. They depict the Martyrdom of St Christopher and the Removal of his Body.",
    "images/WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine/The Holy Family.jpg": "Watteau's Holy Family is composed of flowing forms; the figures are set against a dark rocky ground to the left that serves as counterpoint to the blond infant gently bitten by the dove.",

    "images/PETRINI, Giuseppe Antonio/A Philosopher (1).jpg": "They depict philosophers, astronomers, mathematicians, evangelists and personifications of seasons.",
    "images/CAPELLI, Camillo di/The Chastisement of Love.jpg": "The Chastisement of Love depicts Mars whipping Cupid, pursued by a Fury. The central figure is recognizable as Mars. He is shown whipping Cupid, the bound, kneeling figure at his feet, who is guilty of having made him fall in love with Venus. Feathers plucked from Cupid's multi-coloured wings lie strewn on the ground, together with his broken bow and arrows. Mars is tormented by a monstrous winged female figure with snakes in her hair, firmly grasping his helmet.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/The Chapel viewed from the entrance (1).jpg": "The view towards the choir shows the triumphal arch wall with its fictitious chapels below the depictions of the Betrayal of Judas and the Visitation. Above the dado level of painted marble Giotto articulates the walls using broad ornamental bands and narrower, horizontal strips.",
    "images/PEETERS, Bonaventura I/An Oriental Harbour.jpg": "In a cove overlooking a turbulent sea and under fast-moving clouds, a fortified harbour stretches out on a hill in the right foreground. Crowned by a central building with a western-style entrance, this is nonetheless a Turkish area, as can be seen from the crescent moon on the flag above the fortress and the turbans of the harbour dwellers. Outside the port western ships lie at anchor, one of them flying the English St George's cross from its mizzen mast. The most striking vessel, in the left foreground, a heavily-armed three-master with the Dutch tricolour in front and the arms of Amsterdam on the escutcheon, is still under sail and approaching the harbour. In the right foreground a heavy trunk is being heaved ashore with considerable difficulty from a moored sloop carrying two distinguished men, one wearing a turban, another a fur hat.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Landscape with Noli Me Tangere Scene.jpg": "He placed the Noli me tangere scene (the meeting of Christ and Mary Magdalene after the Resurrection) into a wide landscape depicting Jerusalem in the background and the Golgotha at the right.",

    "images/EYCK, Jan van/Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife (detail).jpg": "The picture represents Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Beethoven Frieze left wall (part 1).jpg": "The frieze begins on the left wall showing female figures gliding along horizontally, referred to in the Beethoven exhibition catalogue as \"Die Sehnsucht nach dem Glück\" (The Longing for Happiness). The outstretched arms of the female figures float as if in water along the top edge of the frieze, while the areas below remain entirely empty.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Haywain (outer wings).jpg": "The foreground is dominated by an emaciated, shabbily dressed man who is no longer young, carrying a wicker basket strapped to his back; he travels through a menacing landscape. A skull and several bones lie scattered at lower left; an ugly cur snaps at his heels, while the footbridge on which he is about to step appears very fragile indeed. In the background, bandits have robbed another traveller and are binding him to a tree, and peasants dance at the right to the skirl of a bagpipe. A crowd of people gather around an enormous gallows in the distance, not far from a tall pole surmounted by a wheel, used for displaying the bodies of executed criminals. Bosch's pilgrim makes his way through the treacherous world whose vicissitudes are represented in the landscape. Some of the dangers are physical, such as the robbers or the snarling dog, although the latter may also symbolize detractors and slanderers, whose evil tongues were often compared to barking dogs. The dancing peasants, however, connote a moral danger; like the lovers on top of the haywain, they have succumbed to the music of the flesh.",
    "images/LELY, Sir Peter/Portrait of Sibyl Masters.jpg": "This three quarter length portrait represents Sibyl Masters (1624-1684), the daughter of Christopher Masters of the City of Westminster, the wife of Humphrey Wyrley, Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas and a Justice of the Peace for Staffordshire. She is sitting on a ledge, a wooded evening landscape beyond. She wears a green silk dress with brown wrap, and a string of pearls.",
    "images/BELLOTTO, Bernardo/View of Dresden from the Right Bank of the Elbe with the Augustus Bridge.jpg": "The panorama of the city, shown in this picture, was to become the classic view of Dresden, seen approximately from the level of the Japanische Palais: the right-hand side of the painting is dominated by the Catholic Hofkirche, shining in its light shades and intensified by its reflection in the river. Behind the Hofkirche we see parts of the royal residence, including the lofty Hausmannsturm, which seems to rest on the roof of the Hofkirche. Rising up directly behind them is the majestic dome of the Protestant Frauenkirche, designed by George Bahr, newly built but already an integral part of Dresden's skyline. The way the river forms a diagonal, or the bank in the foreground a wedge shape, or the building on the far left acts as a link between picture and frame: all accord with specific rules and conventions that developed from landscape painting. Bellotto adds a number of incidental figures, most strikingly an impoverished family at the front left who have settled outside a simple wooden hut.",
    "images/MORALES, Luis de/Madonna with the Child.jpg": "The composition of the painting may possibly be traced to an engraving by Dürer, but the influence of Italian Mannerism is very strongly felt in the delicate elongation of the neck, the tapering of the fingers, the Leonardo-like softness of the features, the sweet expression reminiscent of Raphael and the use of large blocks of strong colour for the garments.",
    "images/LOCHNER, Stefan/Triptych with the Virgin and Child in an Enclosed garden.jpg": "The Virgin Mary sits as the Virgin of Humility on the flowery grass carpet of a hortus conclusus, the enclosed garden of Paradise. This garden is surrounded by a fortified wall, thus turning Mary into a fortress of virginity. The flowers on the lawn, the white and red roses around the Virgin's head and the red rose she is giving to the Child are common symbols of her virginity, her joy and sorrow, as well as the future suffering of Christ. Small dark blue angels crown her as the Queen of Heaven. In keeping with the Cologne tradition, the scene is flanked by standing saints, in this case St John the Evangelist and St Paul.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Hell Fall of the Damned.jpg": "The ascent of the blessed into Heaven is balanced in the third panel by the descent of the damned into the pit of Hell. The damned hurtle past in the darkness, seized upon by devils and scorched by Hellfire spitting through fissures in the rocks.",
    "images/RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste/Two Sisters (On the Terrace).jpg": "The young woman and the girl at her side were not related, the title Two Sisters was later invented by an art dealer.",
    "images/PÉREZ VILLAAMIL, Jenaro/Village Bullfight.jpg": "A bullfight is being held on an area of level ground outside the walls of a village beneath the imposing silhouette of the grandiose, monumental parish church with the appearance of a collegiate church that towers majestically above the scene on a small hillock. The bullfight takes place in the centre of the ring, which is formed by wagons arranged in a circle. Watched by a bustling crowd, a picador is about to weaken the bull with his lance, while other bullfighters around him perform distracting manoeuvres. On the balcony of the building that stands out from the group of houses on the right is the presidential box in which the black-clad local authorities can be distinguished. Locals are grouped around the cross erected at the boundary stone on that side to gain a better view of the action. Meanwhile, visible in the foreground is the motley crowd of friars, country folk, ladies riding in open-topped caleches, stallholders, musicians and street vendors who take part in the festivities. He displays his inventive flair to the full in recreating the appearance of a non-existent village with an astonishing scenographic effect, overlooked by the impressive architecture of a church built from remnants of real architectural features that Villaamil would have sketched during his travels around Spain, later combining them in his studio with a curious eclecticism steeped in the most genuine Romantic spirit to give them a lifelike appearance.",
    "images/CUYP, Aelbert/Starting for the Hunt.jpg": "The present painting represents two young members of a distinguished Dordrecht family: on the left, Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort (1639-1680), and, in the centre, his slightly older brother Michiel (1638-1653). The two boys and their riding instructor wear tight-fitting velvet coats (called \"dolmány\") over elaborate shirts. The coachman to the right wears a looser and heavier coat called a \"mente.\"",

    "images/RING, Laurits Andersen/Girl Looking out of a Skylight.jpg": "The girl's half-averted face and the view of the city rooftops are both linked and kept separate by the play of depth and space created by the slant opening and by the angles and crossbars of the skylight.",
    "images/VIGNON, Claude/Flora.jpg": "Flora is the personification of spring and the synonym of youth, joy of living, abundance, wealth and fertility.",
    "images/HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van/Family Portrait.jpg": "A respectably dressed family is gathered around a table whose white damask cloth is spread with food. The father, looking out at the viewer, has a large purse hanging from his belt; his right hand holds out a wine-glass in an inviting gesture, while the left hand with its signet ring rests on his daughter's shoulder. The youngest child in the mother's lap holds out to the viewer the crucifix that hangs from her rosary. The richly decked table, on the other hand, with its carefully executed tableware and food, takes up the love of detail so characteristic of Early Netherlandish painting.",
    "images/GIORDANO, Luca/Ceiling decoration (detail).jpg": "The picture shows one of the ends of the ceiling in the Galleria Riccardiana (above the entrance) depicting Pallas Athena Handing Ingegno the Golden Key to Recognition of Veritas. Assisted by Mercury, the god of commerce and eloquence, Pallas Athena is presenting a gold key to a personification of Ingegno, identified by an eagle helmet. This key will allow him to recognize Veritas, who is kneeling next to him. On the left Athena is presenting a hammer to two women identified as Industria and Artificium by the tools and utensils lying on the ground and by a swarm of bees. Seated on a rock is a youthful Amphion (or Orpheus), whose lute-playing casts a spell on the denizens of the air and the Roman she-wolf.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/View of Delft.jpg": "Signature: Signed with monogram, below left on the boat. We admire the town, but it is not a profile view of a township, but a painting, an idealized representation of Delft, with its main characteristics simplified and then cast into the framework of a harbour mirroring selected reflections in the water, and a rich, full sky with magnificent cloud formations looming over it.",

The figures in the stained glass window are the Madonna and Child, and the Dominican Saint Thomas Aquinas.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Teams of Oxen.jpg": "The story moves back from the main panel to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella.",

Both half-length figures are placed close to the picture surface against a bright green background. The close attachment of the two people is suggested in their dress: they wear similar caps, his adorned with stitching, hers with a round agrafe.",

    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/St Sebastian (2).jpg": "St Sebastian is standing like a piece of sculpture on a fragment of a building that looks like a pedestal, well above the archers whose heads are at the same level as that of the observer. Our gaze is drawn upwards towards the saint, whose eyes are also looking upwards to higher things. Mantegna introduced an indication of the rivalry between the arts of painting and sculpture: to one side of Sebastian's feet is a fragment of a marble statue, a foot in a Roman sandal.",

It depicts a group of philosophers seated around a naked youth lying on the ground. This large mysterious scene is the pendant of a fresco representing Christ in Majesty in the niche opposite.",
    "images/MALOUEL, Jean/Virgin and Child.jpg": "The half length figure of the Virgin, with the Child supported by her right arm, is shown within the three-dimensional representation of a window-frame. The motif of the window-frame provides the reason why the Virgin is represented as a half length figure. The Child's delicate body is also depicted from the waist upwards, emerging from Mary's wide and velvety soft cloak. (See, for example, the protruding form at the Madonna's right shoulder.) The arrangement whereby the folds of the mantle spread out radially from the Madonna's left wrist is most refined and so is the narrowing down of the blue area of the whole drapery at the bottom part of the picture. The two figures are almost fused together by love, and yet are surrounded by a melancholy mood, the austere premonition of the Passion. The Virgin is absorbed in her thoughts, the Child opens His big, round eyes and looks at the spectator. His forefinger may enjoin silence upon the approaching worshipper.",

    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Aesop.jpg": "Aesop's face with its flattened nose was probably not - as is commonly thought - painted after a man of the people (even if the painting did attempt to show a simple man whose features were marked by toil, and who therefore represented the Cynic ideal of the modesty and wisdom of the people). They are deep-seated and probing, turned on the observer with a slight touch of contempt. The two portraits of philosophers, together with the portraits of fools and dwarfs, were intended to warn the king not to lose touch with the common people and their wisdom.",

    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/Commodore Augustus Keppel.jpg": "The borrowed pose bears the thought of the idealization of the individual. Keppel is standing on a small strip of shoreline in front of a steep cliff-face. The scenery with the storm, the wild surf, the rocky coast and the flickering lightning is in accordance with the aesthetic of the sublime, and enhances the heroic character of the naval officer, who, unimpressed by the forces of nature, poses for the painter. The pose and the landscape idealize the sitter.",

The morning sunshine penetrates under the branches of the walnut tree. Eyes are drawn to the table with white table cloth. Shadows of objects (a fruit basket, apples and a blue carafe) are projected on it, together with the delicate shadow of the basket chair which is not in the picture. The edge of the table running diagonally is accentuated by the arm and trunk of the female figure who is leaning back in the armchair and by the borderline between light and shadow on the leaves. The way he painted the warm colours of faces which are in the shadow of hats is simply superb, just like the grey silk dress.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/The Return of Judith to Bethulia.jpg": "In The Return of Judith to Bethulia, Botticelli shows us Judith together with Abra, her maid, the two of them striding out in a well-nigh furious manner. Abra is carrying Holofernes' severed head on her own head, while Judith has an olive branch in her hand as a symbol of peace, which she is bringing to the Hebrews. Judith is pausing a moment in her striding forward to turn towards the observer, self-assured if not without a touch of melancholy, exactly as if she wished to present herself as the victor.",

    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Head of a Young Peasant with Pipe.jpg": "Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. The models he depicted were shown in traditional dress, and the painter focused in particular on their heads, rarely introducing extra details. He is dressed in a blue jacket with his white shirt showing at the throat. The flesh colours of the face are brightened by touches of red on cheek and lips. Also the glowing bowl of the pipe adds a little liveliness to the otherwise dark picture.",

    "images/MARTINO DI BARTOLOMMEO/Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "The artist seems to have represented here a young girl from the Tuscan countryside and has ennobled her aspect by dressing her in a white mantle with traces of light blue, yellow-lined and edged with a gold ribbon. He made her face graceful by putting on her head a very light, impalpable white veil.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/The Virgin and Child with Four Angels and Six Saints (Pala di San Barnaba).jpg": "At the sides of the curtain, very finely drawn in little tondos, are the two figures of the Annunciation, the Virgin and the Angel. The angels on either side of the tall throne carry the crown of thorns and the nails of the cross, symbols which refer to the passion of Christ. It must be pointed out that, on the steps of the throne, there is for the first time in history of painting an inscription in Italian.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Meditation on the Passion.jpg": "One of the most beautiful of these paintings is this depiction of the Old Testament figure Job and of Saint Jerome as a hermit meditating on the body of the dead Christ. Numerous details underscore the theme of death and resurrection: the bones next to Job, the crown of thorns propped up against Christ's broken throne, the small bird that flies upward from Christ to symbolize the Resurrection. Even the lavishly painted landscape carries the theme by appearing desolate on the left and lush and open on the right.",

    "images/PALMA GIOVANE/Venice Crowned by Victory (1).jpg": "An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings.

    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/Adam.jpg": "The fresco representing Adam is in the vault. Next to Adam is the tree of knowledge with the serpent. The idea of salvation is suggested by Adam's placing his foot on the serpent's tail and by the leaves sprouting from the seemingly dead tree. The child who turns away in terror at the sight of the serpent has been interpreted as either Cain or Seth.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DI PAOLO/Sts Clare and Elizabeth of Hungary.jpg": "The small panels represents two Franciscan saints, St Clare (1193-1253) and St Elizabeth of Hungary (1207-1231), both wearing gray Franciscan habit.",

In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Adonis, spear in hand and with hunting dogs straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.",
    "images/DAVID, Jacques-Louis/Cupid and Psyche.jpg": "Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. David took inspiration from several ancient texts, including an obscure, recently published Greek poem by Moschus that describes Cupid as a mean-spirited brat with dark skin, flashing eyes, and curly hair.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The ceiling (2).jpg": "In the scheme of divisions, the key elements are the thrones of the seers flanked by plinths and colonnettes decorated with pairs of putti supporting the cornice running above the crowns of the spandrels, at about a third of the way across the curve of the vault. Beyond the cornice, the vertical frames flanking the thrones are prolonged as the arches crossing the vault. They divide it into nine compartments in which the stories of Genesis - from the Separation of Light from Darkness to the Drunkenness of Noah - are represented as if they were seen above the space of the chapel, beyond and through the imposing structure of the painted architecture. In the five compartments above the thrones, the field of the narrative scenes is limited in size by the presence of four figures of ignudi, sitting on plinths and bearing garlands of oak leaves and acorns, and of two medallions painted to resemble bronze, with episodes drawn from the books of Genesis, Samuel, Kings, and Maccabees. Lastly, under the cornice and the thrones, in the spandrels and the lunettes at the tops of the walls, are depicted the forty generations of the Ancestors of Christ, from Abraham to Joseph, while the corner pendentives contain representations of biblical scenes associated with the theme of the divine protection of the Jews: Judith and Holofernes, David and Goliath, the Brazen Serpent, and the Punishment of Haman.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Portrait of Laura da Pola.jpg": "The register is kept predominantly low, however, and is almost monotonous in the costume and the background, except for the warm rays of the velvet chair and the explosive colour of the fan. The abstract oval of the face, framed by the regular coiffure and headdress, is reminiscent of the Tuscan tradition. Laura da Pola is shown with a pensive expression, emphasized by the refined rendering of the details of her attire.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/The Buffoon Don Cristóbal de Castañeda y Pernia (detail).jpg": "The buffoon's red robe is almost Turkish in style, and his head-dress suggests a fool's cap. He glares fiercely into space.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Temptation of Christ (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the head of the young devil.",
    "images/GRECO, El/Apostle St Andrew (1).jpg": "The painting depicts the Apostle St Andrew who converted the 'Scythians'; he was the brother of Peter and because he had been a follower of St John the Baptist he was known in the Greek-Christian tradition as Protocleitos (the first of those called). He follows the traditional iconographical way of indicating inevitable martyrdom by depicting St Andrew with the upright of the cross over his shoulder, but the heavy wooden upright is a symbol and not an organic part of the composition. The essence of the picture is the majestic figure of the old apostle in his voluminous cloak; it is a study of a patient and wise teacher. El Greco very skilfully represents the shining silver hair and beard, and reveals exceptional mastery of his art in the painting of the face, especially the eyes, and in the harmony he creates by the use of blue-green-yellow hues in the cloak.",

    "images/THEOPHANES the Greek/Icon from the Deësis Tier (3).jpg": "Deësis (Greek, \"entreaty\") in Eastern Orthodox art is the representation of Christ flanked by the intercessory figures of the Virgin and Saint John the Baptist and other saints. This icon represents Christ as the Pantocrator, the Ruler of All, enthroned with an open book of gospels in his left hand, while his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing.",
    "images/MASTER of Moulins/The Moulins Triptych.jpg": "The Master of Moulins represents the last percussions of the influence of Hugo van der Goes, and does so with exceptional vigour and grandeur. In the wings, Duke Pierre II of Bourbon, with a rueful countenance, faces his formidable wife, of whom he was said to have been the humble servant rather than the husband.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Catalan/Tomb of Don Sancho Saiz de Carillo (detail) (1).jpg": "The backgrounds, in which architecture, furniture, and occasionally utensils are schematically represented, are in monochrome, but the figures that occupy the foreground have an expressive humanity, very different from the hieratic formalism of the past.",

To the left can be seen the huge figure of St Christopher, almost totally lost in the original fresco. He and the small boy to the right are standing partially outside the decorative framework of the fresco, intermediaries between the viewer's space and the narrative of the fresco.",

    "images/TURA, Cosmè/Annunciation.jpg": "The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. On one side was an Annunciation and on the other St George and the Princess, now shown on four separate canvases. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.",

The wings are depicted with an enormously impressive, intense, and above all dazzling polychromy; they are built up gradually from tiny strips of colour of the same hue, which are arranged like overlapping scales and graduated in tone from dark to light, until finally culminate in the plenitude of light of a dazzling white or yellow.",
    "images/CECCO DI PIETRO/St Rainerius.jpg": "Four panels representing full-length saints - Sts Peter, Simon, Rainerius and a bishop saint - have formed part of a larger altarpiece complex flanking a central panel. St Rainerius is the patron saint of Pisa and is shown here as a young pilgrim in his characteristic hair shirt.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Winter Landscape with Church.jpg": "The pendant in Dortmund introduces, for the first time in Friedrich's oeuvre, a Gothic church, seen as a monumental vision emerging out of the mist like a phantasmagoria and rising against the gloomy background of a winter sky. Nearer the viewer, a man is leaning back against a boulder and gazing up the crucifix in front of a cluster of young fir trees. He has flung his crutches demonstratively far away from him into the snow.",
    "images/MASOLINO da Panicale/St Peter Preaching.jpg": "The scene refers to Peter's sermon, as recounted in the Act of the Apostles, which he preaches in Jerusalem after the descent of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost. The fresco actually illustrates the final part of the sermon, when Peter says: \"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" The three bystanders to the left behind St Peter were attributed to Masaccio (their grim expression is truly modern). This scene refers to Peter's sermon, as recounted in the Acts of Apostles, which he preaches in Jerusalem after the descent of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost. The fresco actually illustrates the final part of the sermon, when Peter says: \"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 31 Scenes from the Life of Christ 15. The Arrest of Christ (detail).jpg": "The throngs of people crowd into the centre, towards Christ, who is betrayed by Judas' kiss. With the force of his body Judas presses against Christ, who appears to disappear beneath the traitor's cloak. Surrounded and hemmed in by numerous faces, the profiles of Christ and Judas almost collide. The two look at one another — the one with dignity and seriousness, the other full of malice.",
    "images/SIMBERG, Hugo/Interior of the dome.jpg": "The serpent in Paradise with an apple in its mouth adorns the central dome of the vaulted ceiling. Some contemporaries interpreted the winged serpent on a red background in the highest point of the ceiling as a symbol of sin and corruption.",

    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Life of St Benedict, Scene 28 Benedict Recognizes and Receives Totila.jpg": "The two scenes dealing with the Gothic king Totila, painted by Signorelli, are crowded with figures and full of action, and in a sense fall out of the established framework of the cycle, for here the fathers are confronted with a powerful figure from the outside world. Despite the king's arrogance and trickery, Benedict subsequently receives him, confronts him with his numerous misdeeds, and prophesies his end (Scene 28).",
    "images/ZUCCARO, Taddeo/Scene from the History of the Farnese Family (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the scene of Charles V, Alessandro Farnese, and Ottavio Farnese at the Head of the Imperial Army against the League of Schmalkalden, 1546.",
    "images/ANTONIO DA NEGROPONTE/Madonna and Child Enthroned.jpg": "With a refined naturalistic taste, the painter painstakingly depicted the espalier of roses in the background and the many kind of birds in the foreground.

    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/The Funeral of St Stephen.jpg": "The deceased saint is laid out on the central axis of the nave, distinguished by large columns and clustered pilasters, at a point which must be regarded as the crossing. The young and handsome deacon saint is laid out on his bier in the sweet sleep of death. He is surrounded by mourners, including two women seated on the ground, one of which may be the saint's mother. On either side are figures in modern dress who are in many cases portraits of persons in Prato. In the distance we notice the simply decorated main altar with only a cross, casting its shadow upon the curved surface of the niche-like apse. In this scene, the body of the saint lies within a church setting, but at the right of the scene, through an open door, there  is a glimpse out onto the sharp incline of a mountain scape - a curious detail in the somber scene. Even more bizarre is the rugged rock that actually intrudes into the church interior.",

    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Judith with the Head of Holofernes (2).jpg": "In this panel Judith presents the severed head of Holofernes, the Assyrian general directing the siege of her city, having killed him with his own sword. The virtuous heroine, who seduced the enemy with her coquettish appeal, is dressed in an elaborate contemporary costume that is characteristic of Cranach's courtly mannerism. At the lower right, Cranach placed his insignia, a crowned winged serpent with a ring in its mouth.",

    "images/SANCHEZ COTÁN, Juan/Still-life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber.jpg": "Everyday objects: a melon, cut open to reveal its pale pink flesh, a knobby cucumber, a yellow quince that is past its best, a cabbage with thick leaves. Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme.",
    "images/GIORDANO, Luca/Ceiling decoration (detail) (3).jpg": "The picture shows one of the ends of the ceiling in the Galleria Riccardiana (opposite to the entrance) depicting the Cave of Eternity. On the left, behind the serpent of eternity, Fortuna is seen wearing a blindfold. Aeternitas has her head veiled and holds an orb in her hand, and a nude Natura is squirting milk from her breast. The old man seated in the cave is identified by the hourglass as Chronos. Around this group hover souls waiting to be born. To the right sit the three Parcae, who are receiving the ball of wool from which they spin the thread of life from the hands of a two-faced Janus. The winged youth with the burning torch is a genius of new life. The scene can be interpreted as an illustration of eternity, which envelops the worlds of man and the gods.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Amminadab (detail).jpg": "The man on the left is depicted frontally, sitting bolt upright with his feet together, his forearms resting on his legs, and his hands tightly intertwined, a gesture that seems to betray great interior tension, as does the expression on his face, with its strongly pronounced lineaments under wiry hair held down with a white scarf. He is wearing a pale green cloak with reddish-orange shadows and tight gray-blue hose. From his ears hang two metal earrings of different shapes.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "The Virgin rises up to heaven pushed by a sudden gust of wind which separates the postures of the apostles.

    "images/GENTILE DA FABRIANO/Quaratesi Polyptych Virgin and Child.jpg": "The central panel of the Quaratesi altarpiece shows the Virgin and Child. This panel is flanked by four saints each on a separate gabled panel (now in the Uffizi, Florence). Christ with his foreshortened halo leans out of the little roundel in the gable above the Virgin. Gentile's sumptuous decorative effects can now best be appreciated in the gold brocade, for the once-brilliant cloth of honour behind the Virgin and Child, painted translucent red over silver leaf and green over gold, has darkened and blotched with age. The Virgin, an ideal beauty of her day with fair hair, broad forehead and rosebud mouth, looks out gravely as the Christ Child smiles contentedly, showing his tiny milk teeth. Keeping firm hold of his mother's cloak, he turns from her to the adoring angel, with a daisy - symbol of his innocence, picked in Heaven, the garden of eternal spring - held daintily between his pudgy finger and thumb.",

    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Last Judgment Triptych (detail) (4).jpg": "Christ appears in evangelical guise seated on a rainbow, his feet resting on a gleaming golden globe, surrounded by the twelve apostles and the intercessors Mary and John the Baptist. They are all pictured on a cloud that continues left to the gates of paradise and right to the mouth of hell. The traditional angels with the instruments of the Passion hover in pairs above this divine assembly, while the four angels blowing their apocalyptic trumpets float somewhat randomly above the earth, one of them even appearing high up in the clouds of the right wing. The lily of mercy and the red-hot sword of justice on either side of Christ's head correspond symbolically with the upward gesture of blessing made by his right hand, and the downward one by his left.",
    "images/TERBORCH, Gerard/The Messenger.jpg": "On the contrary, the characters, who are often shown in profile or from behind, are engaged in a silent dialogue of looks that allows us only to guess at the meaning of the event.",

    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/St Sebastian.jpg": "The saint is serenely enduring the six arrows that have been shot into him. Clothed only in a loincloth, he is standing on the stumps of a tree that has been cut to the shape of a stake and which rises suddenly in the centre of the picture, in front of the landscape and sky. The torture is past, Sebastian's tormentors have already moved on and are hunting for herons. The scene showing the torturers leaving is a very rare theme for depiction. The artist is following classical ideas in his harmonious proportions and balanced \"contrapposto\".",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Wedding at Cana (scene 5).jpg": "The eye is drawn to the cheerfully laid table, embellished with the precision of a miniaturist, and to the quick movements of the servants.

    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples.jpg": "The depictions of the two volcanoes, which lead one to meditate on the mysterious and universal force of nature, reflect the artist's Neoplatonic pantheism, based on the belief that the Divine animates the world from within.",

    "images/MASTER of the Berswordt Altarpiece/The Flagellation.jpg": "In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right.

    "images/BOUCHER, François/The Toilet of Venus.jpg": "The cupids and the doves are attributes of Venus as goddess of Love. The flowers allude to her role as patroness of gardens and the pearls to her mysterious birth from the sea. The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.",

    "images/MONET, Claude/Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Right.jpg": "In the two open air studies, Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Left, and Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Right, Monet was fascinated by the very low viewpoint from which the model is shown; she stands on a riverbank against a background of pale blue sky.

The sections below, with their alternating interiors and exteriors, appear as sets in front of which, and in which, the events take place. we move on to the Birth of St John the Baptist, the Virgin on her Way to the Temple, and finally the Marriage of the Virgin.

The subject of Adoration of the Magi was one of the most popular in all fifteenth-century art, especially for the opportunities it presented for the display of rich costumes and accessories, and of numerous subordinate figures with horses and other animals in an extensive landscape. Mantegna, however, restricts his composition to just six figures - with the three magi on the right converging on the three members of the Holy Family on the left - which he shows in half-length, and hence, too, in powerfully expressive close-up.",
    "images/AMIGONI, Jacopo/Venus and Adonis (1).jpg": "Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late.

However, the young man to the right, painted in brighter colours, together with the ox beside him, show Mantegna's finely differentiated style of painting.

On the banners we can see the letters SPQR, the abbreviation of Senatus Populusque Romanus (the Senate and the Populace of Roma).",
    "images/LARCIANI, Giovanni di Lorenzo/Virgin and Child (1).jpg": "In this panel, the artist has set his two figures against one of his characteristic landscapes. Most striking is the exotic, stylised arrangement of palm leaves rising up dramatically behind the Virgin's head.",

    "images/CLEVE, Joos van/St Anne with the Virgin and Child and St Joachim.jpg": "The scene of St Anne with the Virgin and Child and St Joachim presents three generations: the grandparents, the mother and the infant Jesus. The balanced composition with the central figure of St Anne is placed in an equilateral triangle. In the centre, the most important element, lies the infant Jesus, comfortably asleep in his grandmother's lap. Although the divine family forms the centre, attention is immediately drawn to the two wide landscapes onto which the loggia opens: a small, moated castle, some houses, a dovecote. The interior displays considerable wealth: Anne sits enthroned in front of a 'mille-fleurs' tapestry, hung between two porphyry columns with bronze Corinthian capitals. The fabrics are also richly reproduced, with the women's red and blue gold-hemmed mantles standing out strongly against Joachim's fur-lined overcoat. The rich dress and the clearly painted purse hardly fit with the poor carpenter, but with Anne's first husband, who was indeed a wealthy man. This makes the purse on the belt an allusion to the refused offering.",

Rolin is facing towards an elegant imitation statue of St Sebastian executed in grey tint, as if carved from marble. His wife is looking towards another imitation statue, this time of St Anthony, who is accompanied by a young pig.",
    "images/SPAENDONCK, Gerard van/Still-Life (1).jpg": "The present still-life depicts roses, hyacinth, wallflower and other flowers in a lapis lazuli vase. Its companion piece depicts narcissus, hyacinth and other flowers in a brown porphyry vase.",

    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/View of the Frescoes in the Chapel of San Brizio.jpg": "The picture shows a view of the frescoes in the Brizio Chapel of the Duomo at Orvieto. The figures seen in the vaults show the blessed in heaven as part of a panoramic Last Judgment began in the chapel by Fra Angelico in 1447 but left incomplete.",
    "images/OSTADE, Isaack van/Winter Landscape (2).jpg": "The painting depicts a winter landscape with figures on a frozen river, a town beyond. Highlighted near the centre, a group of figures stand in conversation, amongst whom a white horse - a recurring motif in Isaac van Ostade's work - stands with its head bowed.",
    "images/GEERTGEN tot Sint Jans/The Tree of Jesse.jpg": "The artist interprets the subject in a fantastic and worldly way: the sparkling colours of the luxurious robes dominates the scene.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/St Nicholas Providing the Dowry (north wall, right).jpg": "It includes both an exterior view of the house and a view into its interior, showing the bedchamber where the father, visibly worried, and his three peacefully slumbering daughters lie in their beds, and where the saint appears in a window higher up and throws down a bag containing the gold coins intended as a dowry for the girls.",
    "images/MASTER of the Castello della Manta/View of the end (west) wall.jpg": "On the end wall with the fireplace the coat of arms and device of the patron, Valerano Saluzzo can be seen. At left the party of mounted musicians in the vanguard of the Fountain of Youth  train is depicted. At right are Hector and Alexander the Great, the first figures in the cycle of Nine Heroes and Nine Heroines.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/St John Altarpiece (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the left wing.",
    "images/PORDENONE/Golgotha.jpg": "The Crucifixion by Pordenone dominate the nave; an elevated Golgotha towers over the portal of the entrance. Pordenone places the cross at an angle in the picture plane, which moves Christ to the right of centre, making the composition more dynamic. The movement of the riders beneath the crosses echoes the crosses above them. A circular configuration results, and Mary has fallen into a faint at its centre.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Ceiling paintings on the Volksgarten side.jpg": "While the cycle of paintings in the right staircase represents the evolution of the theatre and three classical playwrights, the left-hand side focuses on the themes of music, dance, medieval mystery plays and the extempore stage. All the scenes depict actors together with their audiences. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the artists strove for historical accuracy, which manifests itself in such details as clothing, etc.  In the staircase on the right (on the Volksgarten side), starting from the entrance and with the painting in the tympanum, there is the \"Altar of Dionysos\", \"Thespis' Cart\" (both by Gustav Klimt), \"Ancient Theatre Scene\" (Franz Matsch), \"Shakespeare's Globe Theatre\" (Gustav Klimt), and \"Scene from Molière\" (Ernst Klimt).",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Joseph Accused by Potiphar's Wife.jpg": "Potiphar's wife, the central figure in the tragedy, seems to speak eloquently and nervously as she gestures towards Joseph's scarlet cloak at the foot of the bed. Joseph, standing in the shadow at the left, denies the accusation, while Potiphar, his hand resting uneasily on the shoulder of the aging beauty, clearly shops his indecision and conflict of emotion.",
    "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Crucifixion.jpg": "A turbulent, darkening sky, signifying the eclipse at Christ's death, is seen behind Altdorfer's obliquely placed Crucifixion panel. Mary Magdalen is seen from the back in a melancholic pose, as the other Marys leave with St John the Evangelist and a bearded elder just before the deposition takes place.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Tuccia.jpg": "These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. Tuccia, a Vestal Virgin accused of incest, proved her innocence by a feat that was proverbially impossible.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/View of Campo di San Rocco.jpg": "The photo shows the Campo di San Rocco with the Scuola at the left and the church of San Rocco at the right.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/The Concert.jpg": "In this famous composition by Titian, the half-length portraits of three men are gathered together to play music: in the center an elegantly dressed man with a dark blue fur-trimmed cloak is focused on playing the spinet, a small sixteenth century harpsichord. His hands are still outstretched in the position of the chord on the keys, while his head and gaze are angled left towards the Dominican monk, another musician, who is touching his companion's shoulder to get his attention having taken down his own instrument, a viola da gamba, which now rests at his side. Outside this silent and reciprocal exchange of glance is the young singer on the left, an almost imperceptible smile upon his face and donning a feathered cap, an exquisite and coveted accessory associated with boldness and virility. The faces of the figures at the sides are badly damaged. Only the centre figure and the garment of the figure on the right display his masterful use of colour. The youth on the left draws the observer into the scene, thus including him in the web of glances and touches.",
    "images/BIJLERT, Jan van/Young Girl Holding a Letter.jpg": "This painting, treating a subject very popular in Dutch seventeenth-century genre painting, had a companion piece (now lost) depicting a soldier with a feathered hat.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Valour (detail).jpg": "The the central section of the ceiling of the main hall is flanked by images of Valour (to the left, with laurel wreath and sceptre, shown caressing a lion); and Intellect (with helmet and bow, to the right).",
    "images/HUNT, William Holman/The Lady of Shalott.jpg": "The Lady of Shalott depicts a scene from Alfred Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same title, in which the poet describes the plight of a young woman isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot.",

    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Martyrdom of St Maurice and the Theban Legion (detail).jpg": "The various crucifixions in the background may have been based upon a single three-dimensional small-scale model turned at different angles and actually in one case lying on the ground.",
    "images/GRECO, El/St Ildefonso (2).jpg": "It is related that he saw the Virgin with attendant angles seated on his episcopal throne in the cathedral. As he approached she threw over him a chasuble of heavenly origin. El Greco represent the patron saint of Toledo in full episcopal regalia, holding an elaborate gilt crosier through its green velvet sleeve wearing white kid gloves. He is wearing a spectacular chasuble  embroidered with floral arabesques and exotic birds, lined with pink silk, over a radiant white alb, and on his head an embroidered mitre. He reads a holy book with serious intensity while all around him the sky seems charged with high-voltage static. The saint is illuminated from the left, in contrast to the companion piece of St Peter, who is lit from the light.",
    "images/MARTIN, John/The Eve of the Deluge.jpg": "The figures on the promontory in the foreground are the patriarchs. The seated figure with a white beard is Methuselah, who is surrounded by the family of Noah. Methuselah instructs Noah to open the scroll written by his father, Enoch, so that he can compare the signs in the sky (sun, moon and comet) with those on the scroll. The fact that they match ordains the end of the world and this results in Methuselah's death. The figures hurrying up the slope include those described in the Bible as 'giants in the earth in those days'. In the middle distance, under the trees on the right, is a group of revellers representing the antediluvian age. Ravens, a symbol of ill omen, circle overhead. The ark, which Noah was instructed to build in order to save himself, his family and the animals, is visible on a distant promontory in the background on the right.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Virgin and Child with Grapes.jpg": "In contrast with the earlier variants, the Virgin and Child are placed against a neutral, almost black background and seen closer up, as a result of the picture's tight framing.",
    "images/MAZZIERE, Agnolo di Domenico/Virgin and Child with Sts John the Baptist and Verdiana.jpg": "She is generally represented in painting as a middle-aged nun with two snakes and a basket.",
    "images/SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo/St Matthew and the Angel.jpg": "In the St Matthew and the Angel, a subject appropriate for the Milanese mint insofar as the saint was a tax collector, an angel appears in the darkness to inspire the seated evangelist. Strangely distorting light and shadows play across their drapery and faces, the result of illumination from a small oil lamp placed like a footlight on the table below and in front of them. In the dark recesses at the right two men attend to a seated figure, probably St Matthew in the house of the Queen of Ethopia's eunuch after he had preached and discredited some local magicians. vFlames and sparks from the fireplace throw the three figures into relief, catching St Matthew's hands and face with their light, but consigning the rest of his body to near total darkness. At the far left four small figures wander along a moonlit street. Matthew's peasant's hands, rumpled clothes, contorted neck, and slightly scruffy beard all contribute to the immediacy of the scene, so convincingly real as to be unsettling.",
    "images/HOARE, William/Double Portrait.jpg": "The future Sir William Hamilton is depicted here as a boy.",
    "images/GUARDI, Francesco/Canal Grande with Santa Lucia and the Scalzi Church.jpg": "One looks towards the right bank with the dominating dome of San Simone Piccolo, the other looks in the opposite direction to the church Santa Lucia on the left bank which was pulled down to be replaced by the railway station.",
    "images/STEEN, Jan/The Morning Toilet.jpg": "The girl is shown in a state of undress, provocatively pulling on her stocking and looking directly - and invitingly - at the spectator. It has been argued that she is probably a prostitute - above the arch is Cupid and beside her bed a jewel-case - and yet the scene, framed in an archway, gives few real clues as to her status. We may, in fact, simply be glimpsing a desirable young woman at her toilet. The lute and the music book in the archway (as well as Cupid) associate the scene with the pleasures of love, while the skull wreathed in vine leaves reminds us that such pleasures are fleeting. The chamber pot is a characteristically realistic and down-to-earth element, while the archway with its Corinthian columns and swags of flowers frames this all-too-human scene in a mock grandiose manner.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Noli me tangere.jpg": "Finding the tomb empty, she mistakes him for a gardener, and implores him to tell her where he has moved Christ's body. As he calls out her name she recognises him and, leaning on her jar of ointment, reaches out, saying, 'Master'. Despite some awkwardness in the construction of the figures, Christ and Magdalene fit in harmoniously into the wonderful landscape that takes up most of the picture.",
    "images/MOLA, Pier Francesco/David with the Head of Goliath.jpg": "Figures lying in a landscape in a strong diagonal is a characteristic element of Mola's work and is a pictorial adaptation of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's work.",
    "images/PALMA VECCHIO/A Sibyl.jpg": "The sensuality of the image is reinforced by the use of shallow diagonals to place the figure in the composition, by the colours (light green, cream white and straw yellow), and also by the subtle play of light.",
    "images/MONET, Claude/The Luncheon (Monet's Garden at Argenteuil).jpg": "This picture shows the first house in which Monet's family lived in Argenteuil. In the foreground stands a a bench, a side-table, and the breakfast table. Jean, the young son of Camille and Claude Monet, is playing in the shade by the table. The child's nanny is in the background, and is keeping close watch over him. The garden, enclosed on three sides, is a symbol of a safe world, in which every day is a happy Sunday.",
    "images/CAMMARANO, Michele/Sloth and Work.jpg": "The visual contrast sought by Cammarano is clear in placing in the foreground an idle layabout sharply lit so that his every detail can be seen, while in the background the farmers work side by side almost blending together with each other and the landscape.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Philosophy (ceiling tondo).jpg": "The woman enthroned is enveloped in a garment that has four colours, each of which represents one of the four elements, which in turn are symbolized by their pattern. Blue is for the stars (air), red is for the tongues of flame (fire), green is for the fish (water), and golden brown is for the flora (earth).",
    "images/BEERT, Osias the Elder/Still-Life of Fruit.jpg": "The picture shows a still-life of plums, nuts and apples, raspberries and sweetmeats in three blue-and-white porcelain bowls, together with grapes on a pewter dish, a façon-de-venise goblet, wine-glasses and a piece of bread, all arranged on a wooden table.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Birth of John the Baptist.jpg": "The Archangel Gabriel announced to Zacharias that his wife Elisabeth, already advanced in years and considered infertile, would bear him a son, and when Zacharias doubted the angel he was struck dumb. Tintoretto shows Zacharias (on the right of the picture) recovering his power of speech and breaking into a song of praise to the Lord.",
    "images/KOCH, Joseph Anton/The Schmadribach Falls.jpg": "Here, in this powerful depiction of the mountains, the view is directed both downwards and upwards at once. Peaks that in reality conceal each other now tower one behind the other, all in view. In his depiction of the Schmadribach Falls, certain alterations were made in the geographically precise view and the abundance of topographical details - such as the snowcap added to the mountain on the left, the Grosshorn - in order to heighten the poetic expressiveness and sublimity of the scene.",
    "images/WITTE, Emanuel de/Interior of the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam.jpg": "De Witte portrayed the synagogue during a service, with believers wearing hats draped with pale yellow talliths, or fringed prayer shawls. To the left of middle is the teba, or bimah (the platform in the middle of a synagogue from where the Torah is read), with on it the cantor and the parnas, or synagogue president, and against the back wall the Hechal, or Holy Ark.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Stigmata of St Francis (detail).jpg": "Ghirlandaio shows a path that leads over a ramp to the gate of this monastery. Beyond the gate we clearly make out the monastery church and a courtyard and well. At the bottom of the hill, two figures are busy by a grotto from which a spring is flowing.",
    "images/RAEBURN, Sir Henry/Mrs. Anne Hart.jpg": "The sitter is depicted in an Antique pose.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Supper at Emmaus.jpg": "The figures are relatively large and statuesque, and there is not such effective use of contrasting light and shade or spatial arrangement as in the more mature works.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Temptation of St Anthony.jpg": "This much admired painting, reproduced as early as 1582 in an engraving by the young Agostino Carracci, shows St Anthony beset by two female and two male demons tearing off his clothing. The hermit's habit, ripped apart into the form of a cross, his pale loincloth, and the attitudes of his arms and head show that his torments are a parallel to the Passion of Christ. Perhaps intentionally, the divine figure coming to his aid could at first sight be taken for St Mark, the patron saint of Venice, because of its red and blue clothing.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/The Meeting.jpg": "The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope.",
    "images/GUARDI, Gianantonio/Dergoumidas before the Grand Vizier.jpg": "The scene shows the Armenian priest Dergoumidas condemned to death by the Grand Vizier Ali Pascia for having converted to Catholicism; an episode which actually took place on 5 November 1707.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Virgin Appearing to St Philip Neri.jpg": "The saint stands in profile at the steps of an altar in front of a highly-developed architectural background. His gaze diverted upward in astonishment, he experiences the manifestation of the Mother of God and her Child, who appear to float in the interior of the church on a cloud, accompanied by angels.",
    "images/HERRING, John Frederick the Younger/Feeding Time.jpg": "This canvas depicting horses, pigs and chickens captures the tranquil rusticity of a summer's day on the farm.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Portrait of a Man with Baret and Scroll.jpg": "It is difficult to imagine an innkeeper who made himself depicted with a scroll in his hand. Whereas it seems much more plausible that the imposing subject characterized by a severe and scrutinizing gaze - clad in a silk shirt, a cloak with a fur collar, and a large beret - corresponds to a tax collector.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece The Just Judges.jpg": "Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Crucifixion with Mourners and Sts Dominic and Thomas Aquinas (Cell 37).jpg": "The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers.

    "images/GALLEN-KALLELA, Akseli/Aino Myth (triptych) (1).jpg": "In the story depicted in this set of three panels, or triptych, we see the sage Väinämöinen wooing a young maiden named Aino. She does not want to marry the sage but rather drowns herself. The first scene of the story is shown on the left, the second on the right and the final scene - in which Väinämöinen still seeks to capture Aino, who has turned into a water sprite - in the centre.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Madonna and Child with Eight Angels.jpg": "There is a strict symmetrical structure to the composition with its life- size figures, and the finely toned down colours are very charming. Surrounded by eight wingless angels, Mary is breastfeeding her Child. The angels are holding lilies, the sign of Mary's purity, and are engaged in antiphonal singing: while some of them are calmly waiting to start, the others are singing and reverently looking at a hymn book.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Interior of the Apse.jpg": "The deep apse is divided vertically by slender ribbing, and illuminated by four orders of lancet windows, separated by elegant quatrefoil decorative motifs. Above the high altar rises Titian's celebrated altarpiece of the Assumption.",

    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Life of St Benedict, Scene 27 Benedict Benedict Discovers Totila's Deceit.jpg": "The two scenes dealing with the Gothic king Totila, painted by Signorelli, are crowded with figures and full of action, and in a sense fall out of the established framework of the cycle, for here the fathers are confronted with a powerful figure from the outside world. Despite the king's arrogance and trickery, Benedict subsequently receives him, confronts him with his numerous misdeeds, and prophesies his end (Scene 28).",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Danaë.jpg": "In the centre of the painting an enraptured Danaë sits on two plump pillows on the floor. With her bare legs spread apart, and her deep blue mantle slipping seductively from her shoulders to reveal her right breast, she receives Zeus in the form of the fertile golden rain that gently falls into her lap. In the background, viewed through the columns, are buildings in a mixture of architectural styles: an Italian Renaissance palace, a medieval turret, a north ITalian church tower and lantern, and a Flamboyant Late Gothic edifice.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Supplemental scene (detail) (3).jpg": "Other figures appear in the loggias that open up to the sides of the main scene: at the right, the loggia reveals a view of the grand dining room in Cleopatra's royal palace, with a series of sumptuous silver plates and amphorae.",

    "images/PINTURICCHIO/The Virgin and Child with Two Angels.jpg": "This painting represents a common type of Madonna representations in the Renaissance: the Madonna del latte, the Virgin Mary with one breast exposed and about to suckle the Infant Jesus. The influence of Perugino and the young Raphael is discernible in the picture. In the left background a small figure of the penitent St Jerome is visible.",
    "images/POLIDORO DA LANCIANO/Christ and the Adulteress.jpg": "The foreground is separated from the background, on the right by a fragment of the Colosseum arches while in the rear in a mountainous region, the well-known silhouette of the Colosseum appears.

    "images/GIORDANO, Luca/Psyche Honoured by the People.jpg": "Accordingly, Venus instructs Cupid to arrange for an unsuitable match for Psyche, but instead Cupid himself falls in love with her. He installs Psyche in his palace, but chooses to visit her only at night. Her curiosity aroused, Psyche, although strictly forbidden to look at him, observes Cupid by the light of a lamp, but taken by surprise she allows oil from the lamp to fall on Cupid and so wakens him. To punish Psyche for her disobedience Cupid disappears. He is sought far and wide by Psyche, but in vain. Both Cupid and Psyche thus incur the wrath of Venus. Although expressly told not to open it, Psyche is again overcome by curiosity and opens the casket only to find that it does not contain beauty, but a deadly sleep that overwhelms her. At this point Jupiter, encouraged by Cupid, takes pity on Psyche and consents to their marriage in heaven.",
    "images/FERRARI, Gaudenzio/Crucifixion of Christ.jpg": "Gaudenzio Ferrari painted the enormous Crucifixion of Christ on the end wall of the side aisle above the altar, in which the patron saint of the altar is prominently kneeling beneath the cross. On the adjacent side wall four additional scenes from the legend of Mary Magdalene are arranged in two rows around the central window. In the painting at top left Christ is preaching in the temple whereby Mary Magdalene is converted. The following fresco shows Mary Magdalene washing and anointing Christ's feet at a banquet in the house of Simon. The lower register shows the conversion of the reigning couple of Marseilles. In the Crucifixion of Christ the crucified tower high above the dense crowd of people below.",

    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Deposition (detail) (4).jpg": "The colour of the painting takes into account the darkness of the chapel, so that it glows with an unearthly radiance of pinks, greenish blues, pallid flesh tones, and a vivid orange-scarlet.",
    "images/BURNE-JONES, Edward/The Days of Creation The Third Day.jpg": "In one panel after another, an angel comes to the fore holding a globe, rather like a large crystal ball. As for the angel at the front, each presents a scene associated with the particular day of creation: trees on the third day, for example, a flock of birds on the fifth. The scenes are to some extent mysterious, suggesting more than they show, except perhaps for the last one, of a pale and slender Eve, with a taller, darker Adam. In front of this one, a seventh angel is sitting and playing a stringed instrument - no doubt praising God for the creation.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Zechariah.jpg": "On entering the Chapel (generally through the east door, for contrary to prevalent custom the altar with the 'Last Judgment' occupies the west wall), one can see the Prophet Zechariah enthroned above. The old man is reading from his book, perhaps reciting the passages on the reconstruction of the temple, which he advocated. A crest with the oak of the della Rovere is placed on the console of Zechariah. Twin genii peer over the shoulder of the Prophet with the book. The remaining thrones are occupied by five of the twelve traditional Sibyls.",

In the top right, in mirror image, the painting The Spectre Watches over Her can be seen.",
    "images/VIGÉE-LEBRUN, Élisabeth/Self-Portrait in a Straw Hat.jpg": "She shows herself in the open against a cloud-flecked sky, and - not surprisingly since she is both sitter and painter - as almost a personification of the art of painting. For this fictitious excursion into the fields, but also to demonstrate her powers of observation, she wears a genuine chapeau de paille, unlike Rubens's sitter whose hat is actually made of beaver felt. To the dashing ostrich feather she has added a wreath of freshly picked rustic flowers. Her hair is her own, not a wig, and is left unpowdered. Where Susanna Lunden modestly crosses her arms above her waist and peers out from below her hat, Madame Vigée-Lebrun extends her unaffected friendship to the viewer. Most natural of all, however, is her charming bosom. For unlike Rubens's beauty, whose breasts are moulded by her tight corset, Madame Vigée-Lebrun lets it plainly be seen in her low décolletage that she has no need of such artifice.",

The sleeping youth is Joshua, who had accompanied Moses on his climb. In the left half of the picture Moses and Joshua have returned and Moses is showing the tablets to the people. In the adjacent scene he smashes them to the ground, for he has discovered that in his absence the Israelites, spurred on by Aaron, have been worshipping an idol, the golden calf, depicted  in the centre. The idolators are being put to death in the background on the right.

    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Girl with a Pearl Earring (1).jpg": "This charming portrait of a girl is unfortunately in a very poor state of conservation and suffered from numerous extensive restorations. It is furthermore marred by an ugly pattern of cracks. The girl is seen against a neutral, dark background, very nearly black, which establishes a powerful three-dimensionality of effect. Seen from the side, the girl is turning to gaze at us, and her lips are slightly parted, as if she were about to speak to us. She is inclining her head slightly to one side as if lost in thought, yet her gaze is keen. The girl is dressed in an unadorned, brownish-yellow jacket, and the shining white collar contrasts clearly against it. The blue turban represents a further contrast, while a lemon-yellow, veil-like cloth falls from its peak to her shoulders. The girl's headdress has an exotic effect. A particularly noticeable feature of Vermeer's painting is the large, tear-shaped pearl hanging from the girl's ear; part of it has a golden sheen, and it stands out from the part of the neck which is in shadow. There is surely a similar explanation for the Head of a Girl dressed in a smart, grey dress (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",

At the top, in the frame, two angels are crowning Mary as queen. The throne, which consists of cushions and a drape of honour, has lost all architectural connotations to become a precious, decorated casket. At the sides, four saints, Benedict, Peter, John the Baptist and Miniatus, are depicted with a crown, sceptre, and lilies. The saints are much smaller than the figures in the central panel. Under his cope, he wears a white tunic, identical to those worn by the Olivetan Benedictine monks who lived in the Florentine monastery from 1373. The apostle Peter, next to St Benedict, is holding a book, inscribed with a phrase from the Last Supper: DOMINE TECUM PARATUS SUM ET IN CARCEREM ET IN MORTEM IRE (Lk, 22:33; And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death).",

They are shown gathered together in homage to Seneca, one of the classical exponents of Stoicism, here represented by his bust. Finally, the ruins of the Palatine in the background show that the picture also pays homage to classical culture in the widest sense, symbolizing the resurrection in their own time of the departed glory of Hellenistic-Roman antiquity.",

    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation (front).jpg": "It must have been a folding meditative painting, which could be stood on a cabinet with its wings slightly open. The front of the triptych featured the naked woman in the middle flanked by Death and the Devil, each with an admonitory banderole. The only actual scene on the rear is that of heaven, which appears between emblematic subjects - the coat-of-arms and the skull - in the wings. This woman, with a diadem in her long hair, who looks in the mirror and unashamedly shows off her nakedness but for the sandals on her feet, simultaneously represents Vanity and Lust. To her left there is a griffon, a breed of dog that is customarily included in paintings whose subject is marriage or physical love. The significance of the amorous greyhounds on the right is also clear. The watermill, which constantly alludes in Memling to the Incarnation and which is once again placed prominently in the landscape, might be intended here as a contrast with the sinful ways of the flesh portrayed in the foreground. The woman's genitals in the Vanity scene correspond with the toad - the demonic creature to be seen over the genitals of Death. The glowing reflection of the flames on the bodies in the jaws of hell recalls the Gdansk Last Judgment.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Moonrise by the Sea.jpg": "A contemporary description of the painting says that two men have clambered across the rocks a long way out into the shallows and appear to be waiting for a ship.

Separated by no more than a narrow stretch of water flowing along the lower edge of the painting we see the naked figures of Diana and her companions, almost in a direct line before the hunter and seemingly lined up for the viewer. So Jordaens makes the most of his opportunity, and depicts the women caught performing their post-hunt ablutions in ten different positions, some curiously bent, some standing, and some crouching.",
    "images/DYCK, Sir Anthony van/Portrait of Lucas van Uffel.jpg": "The portrait shows the sitter as a learned gentleman, with signs of his varied interests: dividers, a recorder, the bow of a viola da gamba, an antique head, a drawing, and a celestial globe.",

    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Christ Wearing the Crown of Thorns, Supported by Angels.jpg": "Christ, shown at the centre of this work as a half-length figure supported by two angels, dominates the picture. His naked upper body leans forward and slightly to the left, a movement continued by his head, which bears the crown of thorns and is surrounded by a halo. The face of the Saviour, shown in profile, streams with blood and is partly cast in shadow by the heavy crown of thorns; the eyes and mouth are half-open. Christ wears a white cloth about his loins, and a red cloak slips from his shoulders. The angel to the left is clothed in a white cape held together by a brooch and supports Christ's bent right arm with his two hands, placed one on top of the other. To the right a second angel, mouth open, looks upwards in lamentation. The light, shining flesh tones of the Saviour are lent additional intensity by their contrast with the warm, yellowish-brown of the wall behind. To the right is a narrow stretch of countryside with a tree leaning to the right, in a compositional correspondence with Christ's twisted body.",
    "images/MUNKÁCSY, Mihály/Baby Visitors.jpg": "The painter, who had an impoverished childhood and was just as penniless as a young artist, all of a sudden became rich; now he came to live in a luxurious villa and had a busy social life. In \"Baby Visitors\" the young mother and her new-born baby are visited by girl-friends, but the real topic of the picture is the luxurious interior of the bourgeois salon and the elegant dress of the ladies.",

    "images/BASSANO, Jacopo/Supper at Emmaus.jpg": "There is a certain contrast between the solemn, hieratic figure of Christ and the rough and realistic close-up of the innkeeper on the one hand, and on the other, the little scene of the crouching dog being teased by the cat from a distance. The still-life in the centre of the work standing but against the linen tablecloth is a marvel of pictorial observation.",

    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/The School of Tagaste (scene 1, north wall).jpg": "The picture shows him starting school at the elementary school of Tagaste. The teacher walking towards the young Augustine is greeting him by gently caressing his face. Within the family group his mother, St Monica, is highlighted by means of a golden halo which obeys the laws of perspective. In the simultaneous scene on the right the teacher is punishing a pupil while the little Augustine is attentively studying a school slate with Greek letters on it. From the scale of the buildings and figures it can be seen how far the pictorial space extends backwards. Particularly characteristic of this cycle is the city view with buildings in the style of the Early Renaissance, including depictions of some that really exist.",
    "images/BACICCIO/Portrait of a Lady.jpg": "This portrayal of a lady, head and shoulders, is an excellent example of Baciccio's portraiture style. Noteworrthy is the unusual position of the hand, which arches from the wrist, the fingers with long and supple and the smallest extended upwards.",
    "images/SEURAT, Georges/Model from Behind.jpg": "In the studies to The Models, Seurat affords a glimpse of his studio and the artist's work. Waiting amidst discarded clothing, or dressing, these lean and altogether unerotic nudes are related to the completed Grand Jatte.",

    "images/MELZI, Francesco/Pomona and Vertumnus.jpg": "Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple. His face is that of an old man, only the bonnet identifies him as an old woman. The feet and hands are those of a young person. The motif of his gait, due to which his garments are still fluttering, shows that he has just arrived. At the point where his right wrist is bent, the grapevine is entwined around the elm. The gentle touch of her shoulder with his youthful hand depicts the moment at which he reveals himself to her. Pomona's eyes are still lowered longingly while he is already gazing at her passionately.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Virgin and Child.jpg": "It was suggested - not convincingly - that the Portrait of a Monk in the Louvre, which has approximately the same size, formed the right wing. Both the Virgin and the Child bear some resemblance to their counterparts in Michelangelo's Bruges Madonna, particularly in the sweet but somber countenance of the Virgin and the twisted torso of the Child.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The Conversion of Saul.jpg": "He lies on the ground as if just thrown from his horse, prostrate with awe, or unconcious. He may be wearing Roman armour. Christ appeares in the heavens, perhaps with three angels. Paul's attendants run to help him or try to control the rearing horses. Starting at the top left it flows diagonally, along the figure of Christ descending and a beam of light. It follows a figure with raised fingers and another, bent over the fallen Saul, and circumscribes the ellipse of this body. From his right leg it curves back and upward in the direction of a horse galloping in the background, and loses itself in the undulating contours of the mountains with a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem faintly outlined in their folds - unless we accept a more literal explanation and call it Damascus. The high-light on the head of Saul and on the horse's head confirms the symbolic meaning; the dim awarness of fallen man is touched by the lightning flash of grace, and as universal conciousness awakens in him, he loses his animal torpor and gains true knowledge.",
    "images/ORCAGNA/St Matthew and Scenes from his Life (detail).jpg": "The detail shows two scenes: St Matthew tames the two dragons of Vadabar (above) and Vocation of St Matthew (below).",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Temptation on the Temple (scene 2).jpg": "The tiled floor and the pillars, visible in the interior of the building in the Temptation on the Temple, are rendered successfully in perspective; they accompany the polygonal form of the building, without breaking up its rigorous geometry.",
    "images/OSTADE, Isaack van/Interior of a Peasant House.jpg": "In this almost monochrom, brownish-yellowish painting a collection of objects of the everyday life of the peasants can be seen. This peasant room is warm and large like a barn and contains a collection of everything necessary for feeding men and animals. He and his family are grouped round the fireplace trying to get warm, and the man's stance, though awkward, seems to indicate that he is master of his rather poor house. The colours are all different shades of brown and yellow.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Jacob - Joseph (detail).jpg": "Sullen and perplexed, wrapped in a huge yellow ochre cloak and seemingly withdrawn, the old man - generally believed to be Jacob - dominates the family group on the left due to his expressive power and the quality of the colour.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Census at Bethlehem (detail) (1).jpg": "Mary with the Christ child is sitting on a donkey, the ox visible behind her. Joseph is striding out in front of them in the direction of the inn where the tax collectors or census officials are.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Claudian.jpg": "The picture shows an additional poet portrait from the wainscoting panels.",
    "images/PIOLA, Domenico/Autumn Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg": "Spring is represented by Mars and Venus, presented as contrary forces suggestive of the months they dominate. The image and spirit of summer are embodied  by an extremely foreshortened Apollo-Helios, barely recognizable against the glowing sun, and a lion symbolizing summer's zenith. Autumn is personified by Bacchus with Ariadne and his train made up of satyrs, Maenads, and cupids.",
    "images/BIAGIO D'ANTONIO/Scenes from the Story of Io.jpg": "In order to deceive his wife Juno, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer, seen here at left, but Juno, aware of the ruse, demanded to be given the cow as a gift. When she charged the hundred-eyed Argus to watch over the heifer, Jupiter sent his loyal servant Mercury to rescue Io, seen upper left. Io, still in the form of a heifer, is subsequently seen panting on the bank of the Nile fleeing from Juno's persecution. She is depicted looking up begging for forgiveness from the queen of the gods, seen upper right beside Jupiter, who also pleads on Io's behalf. Io was indeed eventually forgiven and is seen restored to her human form on the right side of the bank where she is welcomed back into her family.",
    "images/MIGNON, Abraham/A Glass of Flowers and an Orange Twig.jpg": "This still-life, which was painted in the 1660s, shows a bulbous vase resting on a stone ledge. The arrangement in the vase contains a variety of flowers, including roses, carnations, irises, Chinese lanterns and poppies, interspersed with ears of corn, a stalk of blackberries and an orange twig. To the right is a wilting tulip, below which we see gooseberries and a thistle entwined by bindweed. A number of snails and insects, including butterflies and dragonflies, spiders, beetles, ants, bees and caterpillars, inhabit the picture. The thorny stems, magnified by the glass bowl as if by a reading glass, form a strong contrast to the rounded forms of the flowers with their soft, velvety petals. In keeping with this, Mignon has arranged the flowers asymmetrically; the three prominent striped tulips create strong accents in the picture's upper half that are offset by the compact motif of the three roses at the left. The blades of grass, ears of corn and blackberry stalks contrast with the full, heavy blooms. Illumination comes from an outside source on the left that lights the canvas almost front on. Most strongly illuminated are the triple-rose motif and the carnation that hangs below the ledge. The monochrome background, which produces scarcely any depth, and the lack of a middleground heighten the plasticity of the flower arrangement in the foreground.",

    "images/GÉRICAULT, Théodore/Grey Horse Called L'Aly.jpg": "This painting belongs to a series, painted by Géricault between 1810 and 1814, depicting horses in a stable.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/The Mystic Marriage of Sr Catherine.jpg": "Nevertheless, it shows a scene of tenderness and joy as the Christ Child, watched over by his mother Mary, his grandmother Anne and his earthly father Joseph, places a wedding ring on the finger of the princess Catherine while his little cousin, the child Baptist, plays with his attribute of a lamb. Contributing to the happy mood are the warm and generally light colours, which are applied, as is especially evident in the figure of St Catherine, with a characteristically Venetian freedom and brilliance.",
    "images/CAVALLINI, Pietro/Esau Appears to Isaac (fragment).jpg": "The posture of Isaac in bed; drawing back as he recognizes the deceit, raising his left hand in horror, the architecture of the bed-chamber - all correspond closely to motifs found in the Assisi fresco, though the artistic realization is clearly of lesser quality.",
    "images/VENNE, Adriaen Pietersz. van de/Summer.jpg": "The brilliantly lit scene of ice skating, ice fishing, and ice sailing is one of fun and flirtation, since warm weather is the time when the poor work in the fields and the wealthy travel.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Josiah - Jechoniah - Shealtiel (detail) (1).jpg": "Josiah, the son of Amon, is usually considered to be the man depicted on the right side of the lunette, and Jechoniah the child that he holds on his knees. The man's face is strongly characterized both by its physiognomy and the tensely alert expression; this is defined by a very clean-cut profile and modeled with remarkable vigour. The vigorous manner by which the man turns his head, the relationship between his neck and the cloak covering his shoulders, and the deep, sculptural rendering of the folds bring to mind the splendour of classical reliefs or the models of Roman portraiture.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/Maestà (detail) (9).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the frame: medallion with Christ Blessing.",
    "images/HALS, Frans/The Merry Drinker.jpg": "The Merry Drinker is painted in a bright, blond tonality which anticipates nineteenth-century Impressionism in its most brilliant manifestations. The picture also shows Hals supreme mastery of one of the principal preoccupations of Baroque artists: the rendering of instantaneous emotion and movement.",
    "images/MALOUEL, Jean/Virgin and Child with Angels.jpg": "It follows the gracefully hieratic mode of the International Style, seen especially in the cascades of calligraphic drapery and the elegantly elongated fingers of the Mother and Son.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Sts Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse.jpg": "The first uncertainty concerns the bishop saint on the right holding a book bearing the inscription \"De civitate Dei\", which has led some scholars to identify him with St Augustine. Besides, the Anjou lilies on the bishop's cloak confirm that it must be the French noble Louis, who renounced the throne to become a Franciscan. In this he provides a contrast with Christopher, an emblem of the active faith and preaching, and both are placed under an arch, a symbolic image of the church, on which the second verse of Psalm 14 is written in Greek: \"The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God\". Beyond the parapet St Jerome, a hermit and doctor of the Church, represents the highest point of spiritual life, that of mystical exaltation and revealed science. Beside him the fig-tree symbolizes that he has been chosen by the Lord to understand its supreme law.",
    "images/GUERCINO/Magdalen and Two Angels.jpg": "The artist depicted the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the angels in front of Christ's empty sepulcher as narrated in the Gospel of John (20:11-15). Guercino emphasizes the clasped hands of the kneeling saint, whose face is contorted in sorrow as she leans against the closed tomb - empty now that Christ has risen. The Magdalen's gaze is directed towards the large nail held by an angel at the right.",

    "images/MANSUETI, Giovanni/St Jerome in the Desert.jpg": "This relatively small panel shows a subject that became very popular in Venetian painting in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, thanks above all to the example of Giovanni Bellini. Mansueti shows many of the details that had already become conventional for paintings of the subject: the crucifix, the lion, the rustic dwelling, the discarded cardinal's robe and hat, and symbols of human mortality, such as the skull and hourglass. But in contrast to St Jerome pictures by Bellini and by other Venetian painters such as Cima and Lotto, Mansueti packs his composition with an enormous amount of further detail: a bear, a stoat, a dog, a deer, a rabbit, two monkeys, and two leopards in the foreground; a shepherd with sheep and cows in the right middleground; a river with gondoliers, washerwomen, swans and ducks, also in the middleground; and winding roads, with a man and his donkey, and other men walking and riding, leading the eye to a church, a castle, and distant mountains in the background.",

    "images/BLES, Herri met de/Extensive Coastal Landscape with the Calling of St Peter.jpg": "The subject of the painting is taken from the Gospel of St John, (XXI, 6–10); the figures enacting it are typically set in an immense vista, dwarfed by the towering, fantastical bluffs and buildings above and beyond them. In the foreground on the edge of Lake Galilee, Christ appears to his disciples for the third time following his resurrection. St Peter is seen trying to reach Him across the waves, while to the right the figures appear again in a slightly later episode gathering to grill the fish they have just miraculously caught. The remarkable eagle-shaped overhang in the rocks may be intended as a symbol of the Evangelist and thus refers to de Bles's biblical source. Upon it may be spied a small owl sitting in a cleft, a pun on the painter's nickname (civetta in Italian) and his frequent form of signature.",
    "images/SALVIATI, Cecchino del/The Story of David (3 scenes).jpg": "In the centre David Dances before the Ark of the Covenant. We can see the figure of Michal, gazing out of the window, who sees David dancing and despises him for it, because he had thereby uncovered himself before the handmaids of his servants as only fools uncover themselves. The scene above the centre image represents David Spares the Sleeping Saul. The third scene at the top left corner depicts Michal Rescues David from Saul's Persecution. To the left and right of the picture of David dancing, we find, on the picture frame, two naked or only very lightly clothed youths. They belong not to the depicted scene but rather to the world of paired figures who hold chiaroscuro images on the other walls above the scenes. The remarkable third naked youth, with wings on his shoulders and feet balancing a scale on a razor blade, is the god Kairos, the personification of Opportunity.",
    "images/ROMBOUTS, Theodor/Card Players.jpg": "Though no alcohol is depicted, coins are strewn about the table: a reference to the ‘unwholesome' activity of gambling.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece The Offering of Abel and Cain.jpg": "The scene at top of the niche containing the figure of Adam depicts in grisaille the Offering of Abel and Cain. The scene prefigures both the sacrifice of Christ and the Eucharist.",

    "images/STEEN, Jan/The Rhetoricians - In liefde vrij.jpg": "It is true that the artist portrays himself here as a highly amused spectator among the audience that is paying its respects in the door of an inn where a \"declamator\", the speaker of the society, is reading a text. Almost all the figures and physical signs identifying a rhetorical chamber as such can be found in the painting: apart from the declamator, announcing his performance with the large drum, we can suppose the serious-looking man behind him to be the \"factor\" or poet. The \"emperor\" or \"prince\", the flagbearer and the fool are recognisable by the respective attributes: a crown, a flag and a dunce's cap with a cock's feather. A crock and a drinking beaker hang outside the open door, which is partly shaded off by a carpet, an essential item of décor during performances. A quatrain, attached to a wreath of flowers, announces the philosophy of life of the happy band.",
    "images/LEONARDO da Vinci/Annunciation (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the angel annunciating. The archangel Gabriel is kneeling as a dignified profile figure and raising his right hand in greeting to Mary, indicating her divine pregnancy. He has a solid corporeity, suggested by his shadow on the grass, and the folds of his clothing, which would seem to show studies from real life. His wings too are based on those of a mighty bird of prey.",
    "images/DOU, Gerrit/Old Woman Reading a Bible.jpg": "The face Dou painted is like a mask; it has a frozen surface which appears to have been over-exposed to the light. The woman is reading about the entry of Jesus into Jericho, an episode from St Luke's Gospel. The illustration shows the tax-collector Simon, who climbed into a tree to observe the event. Jesus, who is shown looking up at him, went to the man's house despite his disciples' objections to his visiting a tax-collector, for the profession was considered corrupt.",

    "images/GENTILESCHI, Orazio/Sts Cecilia, Valerianus and Tiburtius.jpg": "The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino. Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. Every element is brought into complex play in this highly articulated composition, from the tips of the wings and the palm branch to the edge of the red mantle, St. Valerianus' foot and the velvet cushion.",

    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness (1).jpg": "Hagar, Abraham's handmaiden, with whom he had conceived the illegitimate son Ishmael, had been driven from the house by Sarah. The theme of this representation is the appearance of the angel, who saves the completely exhausted Hagar, leaning against an empty barrel in the desert, and her son from dying of thirst, and who prophecies that Ishmael shall be made the \"father of many nations\". With an energetic gesture he points out the way, which, in reference to the central ceiling painting The Sacrifice of Isaac, leads away from the divine light.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Sacrifice of Noah (detail).jpg": "The figures of the youth dragging the ram and the one taking the viscera of the animals were painted by Domenico Carnevali around 1568, after the original figures were lost as a result of the detachment of the intonaco caused by instability in the structure of the wall. The work of assistants has been detected in the one of the youth on the left who, lighting the fire under the altar with a torch, shields his face from the heat with his hand.",

    "images/COROT, Jean-Baptiste Camille/Agostina.jpg": "Seen slightly from below as she leans on a stone balustrade, the figure of a young Italian woman rises monumentally and with well-nigh classical statuesqueness against an atmospherically diaphanous background, consisting of a rocky slope with farmhouses, a tree trunk cut off at the right edge of the canvas, and a predominant sky dotted with small, gold-tinged clouds. The dense blue and black hues of the woman's garments set the figure off markedly from the background ambience. The dignified and serious basic mood of the picture is concentrated above all in the melancholy, shaded eye area of the face. The Italian costume, exquisite pearl necklace, and especially the noble facial features framed by wonderfully arranged black hair, exude a classical dignity, as if some figure of ancient legend had suddenly materialized before our eyes. She embodies the land of longing, Italy, and the charm of that intermingling of classical grandeur and subjective mood which every Romantic current in art again and again sought in the Mediterranean world.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Portrait of a Young Venetian Woman.jpg": "From the portraits, an extraordinary charm emanates, which cannot be merely attributable to the shades of brown and gold of the hairdo and clothing, which are set apart from the uniform black background. It is the slight wave of the hair on the clear, high forehead that imperceivably becomes curls caressing the girl's cheeks. It is the dreamy gaze that shows, under the slightly lowered eyelids, the radiant, black eyes. It highlights the play of light on the forehead and on the cheeks. It is the candour of this face, of the neck and chest, emphasized by a neckline of a contrasting colour, that evoke the image of the ideal purity of a girl. With great ability, the artist includes in this image a long and pronounced nose and large, sensual lips, immersing the whole figure in a light that reveals the important influence of the Venetian school, and, in particular, that of Giovanni Bellini. This charm is also shown in the movement in the double rows of pearls, interrupted by the darker shapes of doubled cones, making the pendant curve slightly from the neck.",

    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/St Augustine Teaching in Rome (scene 6, south wall).jpg": "The scene of St Augustine Teaching in Rome shows the saint as an older man and scholar of rhetoric. The parallel lines converge on the figure of the saint. The two listeners sitting to the right of him are repeated on the left as almost mirror images, thereby supporting the balance of the spatial composition. The pictorial space opens out towards the teacher. The dog sitting on the floor in the foreground is given a predominantly negative status in the Bible.",

    "images/CRIVELLI, Carlo/Madonna and Child; St Francis of Assisi.jpg": "This majestic Virgin, richly clad in a gold-embroidered mantle, is holding the Child on her knees. The hieratic grandeur emanating from her, augmented by the high-backed throne and the intangible space created by the gold background, is somewhat tempered by the deep gentleness of her face and the delicate gesture of the hands surrounding the Child's body. Emphasis is placed on the hands, full of tenderness in the case of the Virgin, tensed in an elegant gesture of pain in the case of St Francis, who is dressed in the long Franciscan habit which he opens to reveal his stigmata. The top register consisted of the Virgin, flanked by St Peter and St Catherine of Alexandria to the left and by St Francis of Assisi and St Mary Magdalen to the right. At the centre of the upper register was a Pietà, surrounded by St Claire, St Louis of Toulouse and two unidentified saints. The praedella was made up of 11 parts representing the apostles.",

The elaborately decorated marble doorway in the Betrothal of the Virgin, with its striking frieze and pilaster, together with the circular building behind it and to the left, demonstrate the painter's interest in architecture, both ancient and contemporary, which he could have seen in Rome.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/St Luke.jpg": "Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel. The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds.",

On the left is St Barbara with her tower, and beside her St Christine with the millstone with which she was martyred. Across from her sits Princess Catherine with her wheel and sword, who is looking at Mary Magdalene holding the jar of ointment with which she anointed the dead Christ.

They sit in a marble-paneled niche, the panels below showing a selection of scenes from the life of Hercules. Deianira sits on the tunic that will later cause his demise.

The spandrel is situated over the Rehoboam-Abijah lunette. The woman, seen in profile, is seated in the foreground, in an absorbed attitude, her chin resting on her hand; with her other arm she embraces her child. Behind her, the gray-haired head of a male figure emerges from the shadows. Above, on each side of the ram's skull, the bronze nudes no longer take the form of motionless, reclining figures, but are howling demons who struggle furiously in almost acrobatic positions in the restricted space enclosing them. It is usually assumed that the male figure in the shadows represents Solomon, the father of Rehoboam.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Three Temptations of Christ (detail) (4).jpg": "The fresco represents Christ's threefold temptation by the Devil. In the centre, we see Christ and the Devil standing on a temple, with the Devil attempting to persuade Christ to cast himself down.",

In the right background of the fresco they are sen preaching on the steps of the temple; the pagan idol in the temple falls from its column. In the background on the left there are episodes from the story of the conversion of the reigning couple. Ferrari shows the return of the ruler. His ship docks again on the island, where his son is found alive and his wife is resurrected in response to his prayers. In the middle ground Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Maximus greet the couple on their return to Marseilles. In the foreground Maximus, Mary Magdalene, and their attendants receive the reigning couple into the community with their blessing.",

The background lake is given over to mixed bathing, but in the middle section the sexes are carefully segregated. The circular pool is occupied only by women, while the men ride around it on the backs of animals of different species. The antics of the acrobatic riders, one somersaulting on the back of his mount, suggest that they are excited by the presence of the women, one of whom is already climbing out of the water.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Virgin and Child (1).jpg": "It was suggested - not convincingly - that the Portrait of a Monk in the Louvre, which has approximately the same size, formed the right wing. Both the Virgin and the Child bear some resemblance to their counterparts in Michelangelo's Bruges Madonna, particularly in the sweet but somber countenance of the Virgin and the twisted torso of the Child.",

The subject is found in northern Baroque painting and shows Dorinda lying in the arms of the old servant Linco. Silvio kneels beside her, offering an arrow to Linco, at the same time baring his breast, since he has no further wish to live. Its emotional content serves as the setting for a mythical and poetic event.",

Erminia tends her lover's bloody wounds with the braided tresses of her own hair. The depiction of the subject was influenced by two famous Christian themes: The Lament over the Dead Christ and St Sebastian Tended by Pious Women.",
    "images/BRAMANTINO/Madonna del Latte.jpg": "The fortified brick town and the misty lake seen in the background of this painting are typical of the landscape around Milan.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Parnassus (1).jpg": "In the centre of the painting representing a mythological scene the dancing Muses are easily identifiable, both on account of their number and the presence of the mountains in the top left of the picture. There was a tradition that the song of the nine sisters caused volcanic eruptions and other cataclysms which could only be stopped by Pegasus stamping his hoof - and indeed we see, on the right, the winged and bejewelled horse engaged in his providential pawing of the ground. Beside him is Mercury, whose presence is justified by the protection which he (together with Apollo) afforded the adulteress in the love affair between Mars and Venus. The two lovers hold sway over the scene from the top of Parnassus; a bed is beside them. The cuckolded husband, Vulcan, springs out from the entrance of his forge, fulminating against the faithless pair. Apollo is seated lower down, his lyre in his hands. Mantegna has integrated the landscape elements with the figures, using rocky cliffs as foils, while the central arch permits a deep vista into the rolling landscape. Stocky and heavy-limbed, they plant their weight solidly in easy contrapposto.",

    "images/MUNCH, Edvard/Portrait of Hans Jæger.jpg": "The subject sits leaning back in a sofa, weighing us up through his spectacles with a direct gaze. His hat and tight-fitting overcoat emphasise his aloof and impassive aspect. The cool light streaming in through the curtains to the left casts deep shadows creating shimmers of red-violet, brown and bluegreen hues.",

    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/Vault and apse decoration.jpg": "The picture shows the painting of the vault of the Cappella dei Santi Sacramento with Apostles in Veneration of the Eucharist, and the apse vault with the Throne of Grace. In conformity with the function of the chapel, the towering, highly animated apostles are shown gazing on the Eucharist in a brilliant aureole, framed by powerful rays of light and angels.",
    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/Cupids at Play.jpg": "One element that was unusual for Venetian art at the time was the four large shells, painted inside stucco shells on the ceiling, on which frolicsome putti are depicted playing with lions and tigers.",
    "images/ORCAGNA/Triptych.jpg": "It represents the Virgin and Child with Sts Mary Magdalene and Ansanus. By concealing the sides of the throne Orcagna gave the Virgin a weightless quality; she seems to be floating, in contrast to the sense of weight conveyed by the saints standing beside her.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Crucifixion.jpg": "Particularly impressive about this painting are the wonderful colours and the modulated lights on the body of Christ, as well as the carefully painted landscape, which is a rare feature in Titian's late work. The ruins, the city in the background, and the marvellous colours of the hills are reminiscent of Veronese's early landscapes. The cross, isolated in front of the broad landscape, gives the painting a timeless quality that emphasizes its devotional function.",
    "images/CONSTABLE, John/The Hay Wain (1).jpg": "The view is of farmer Willy Lott's cottage on a mill stream of the River Stour near Flatford Mill, of which Constable's father had the tenancy. In this final version, Constable omitted a figure on horseback at the edge of the stream, substituting a barrel that he later painted out (but which is beginning to show through).",
    "images/DELPY, Hippolyte-Camille/The Pont Neuf and the Quai des Orfèvres, from the Place du Pont Neuf.jpg": "In the distance, across the left bank we can see the dome of the Panthéon, and beyond it the spire of the church of Saint Severin. The building at left has been refaced, giving it a more elegant appearance, but otherwise the view today is almost unchanged.",
    "images/TADDEO DI BARTOLO/St Gimignano.jpg": "Geminianus is rarely appears in art, but when shown is typically depicted as a bishop holding a mirror in which the Mary is reflected; a bishop holding a model of the town of Modena; a man calming a storm at sea; or a man exorcising the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Jovian.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/Scenes from the Life of St Francis (Scene 10, north wall).jpg": "The dancing girl from the \"Fioretti,\" who is shown here between the two main figures in the scene, has been ordered by the Sultan to attempt to seduce the saint, and she later converts. From the throne room of the richly-decorated palace Sultan Melek-el-Kamel and his servants follow the amazing events by which Francis proves God's protective powers. Only the date palm behind the red brick wall gives an indication of the oriental setting.",

    "images/UDEN, Lucas van/Alpine Landscape.jpg": "The painting shows an extensive alpine landscape with travellers and dogs below a large waterfall.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Judith Beheading Holofernes.jpg": "She seeks out Holofernes in his tent, makes him drunk, then beheads him. The sight of their commander's bloodstained head on the battlements of Bethulia puts the enemy to flight. In the painting, Judith comes in with her maid - surprisingly and menacingly - from the right, against the direction of reading the picture. The general is lying naked on a white sheet. Paradoxically, his bed is distinguished by a magnificent red curtain, whose colour crowns the act of murder as well as the heroine's triumph. In contrast to the elegant and distant beauty of the vexed Judith, the ferocity of the scene is concentrated in the inhuman scream and the body spasm of the giant Holofernes. The upturned eyes of Holofernes indicate that he is not alive any more, yet signs of life still persist in the screaming mouth, the contracting body and the hand that still grips at the bed. The original bare breasts of Judith, which suggest that she has just left the bed, were later covered by the semi-transparent blouse.",
    "images/NARDO DI CIONE/View of the chapel from the east.jpg": "The picture shows the Strozzi Chapel from the east. On the west wall is the Last Judgment, on the south wall (left) the Paradise, on the north wall (right) the Hell can be seen. The figures in the stained glass window are the Madonna and Child, and the Dominican Saint Thomas Aquinas.",
    "images/SOLARIO, Andrea/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The austerity of this portrait of an unidentified young man, similar to the portraits by Antonello da Messina, is emphasized by the dark, almost black colour which surrounds the face, on which all the light falls. The surrounding black is only broken by the line of white of the collar and the lighter line which marks the opening of the sitter's outer garment. The long, carefully groomed hair conforms with late 15th-century fashion, which had moved away from the richness and luxuriousness of clothing of the earlier part of the century towards a much plainer style, possibly in line with the spiritual mood of the times.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Personification of Justice.jpg": "To the sides of the ceiling in the grand staircase, four large, faux Palladian windows, half-hidden by groupings of clouds, hold two theologian virtues - Hope and Charity - and two cardinal virtues - Justice and Fortitude - all accompanied by their respective attributes. Hope, Charity and Justice are drenched in light, whereas Fortitude is in shadow. Justice is shown with the peacock of Pride, which falls, pierced by an arrow.",
    "images/MANDER, Karel van, the Elder/Allegory of Nature.jpg": "In the centre is an allegorical scene in which Nature in the guise of Cybele with her many breasts is drawing the attention of a muscular, bearded man to a woman with rays around her head holding the two tablets of the law, who probably symbolizes Wisdom.",

    "images/HALS, Frans/Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse.jpg": "It has been convincingly argued that the unusual expression on the face of the Regent who is seated on the right is the consequence of partial facial paralysis rather than - as the legend has it - drunkenness. The standing figure, without a hat, is the servant of the Regents.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Piazza San Marco Looking South-West.jpg": "Here he shows a 'fish-eye' view of the Piazza San Marco, which may well have been plotted with the help of a lens.",
    "images/BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio/Still-Life.jpg": "The present still-life depicts pears, peaches, figs, a melon, cabbage and marrow. Each grouping of fruit or vegetables is thoughtfully and delicately placed, yet each object and placement seems premeditated and assertive within the composition.",
    "images/BOR, Paulus/Seated Nude Bathing by a Stove.jpg": "In the present work a young naked woman is seated in a very spare interior, the most notable features of which are the expanse of greyish-brown wall and, in the left corner, a small stove.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Conversion on the Way to Damascus.jpg": "Caravaggio is close to the Bible. The horse is there and, to hold him, a groom, but the drama is internalized within the mind of Saul. He lies on the ground stunned, his eyes closed as if dazzled by the brightness of God's light that streams down the white part of the skewbald horse, but that the light is heavenly is clear only to the believer, for Saul has no halo. The horse, based on Dürer, looks hemmed in, there is too much happening at the composition's base, too many feet cramped together, let alone Saul's splayed hands and discarded sword.",
    "images/MASTER of the Hartford Still-life/Table with Fruit and a Vase of Flower.jpg": "This painting and Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus at the National Gallery in London have several elements in common: the vantage point is elevated and set back, the items on the table are shown in perspective, and there is a table cover with stylised geometric motifs, overlaid by a white table cloth.",

    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Ecce Homo.jpg": "Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame. The figure of Christ is displayed covered in weals from the flagellation, and with the crown of thorns on his head. Of the two men holding him, one is wearing a paper headband with an inscription in pseudo-Hebrew. Two other figures are barely visible in the background. The unfolded sheet of paper in the top corner bears the proclamation of the crucifixion.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/St Mary Magdalen and St Catherine of Alexandria.jpg": "On the underside of the entrance arch of the Cappella di San Martino eight full-length saints are painted in four pairs.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Hungarian/Marriage of Saint Catherine.jpg": "The calm, seemingly immobile figures, the effective silhoutte of the decorative crowns, the spatial depth scarcely emphasized in spite of the tiling of the floor and the gilded background, are characteristics of fifteenth century pictorial art. Barbara, seen holding a tower in the lower left corner, Catherine sitting above her with a broken wheel in her lap and, on the other side of the Virgin, St. Dorothy with a basket of flowers, and Margaret leading a dragon on a leash like a dog, are the noblest of the martyr virgins. St. Catherine having been regarded as the highest ranking among them, it is on her finger that the Infant Jesus slips the engagement with a play boyish gesture. As the role of a betrothed would not have befitted the adult Christ, He is represented here as an Infant in his mother's lap, an ingenious idea hinting at the irrationality of the event.",
    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/Old Testament scene.jpg": "The picture shows the scene depicting Susanna accused by the old men, and praying before Daniel.",
    "images/KERSTING, Georg Friedrich/At the Mirror.jpg": "The painting represents a rear view of a figure, a popular theme of the painters of the time.",
    "images/PYNAS, Jacob Symonsz/Mercury and Herse.jpg": "Mercury, who has just punished the shepherd Battus for disloyalty, is flying over the farmlands and woods of Attica when he spots a procession of young girls wending their way to the sanctuary of Minerva. Conspicuous in the procession for her beauty is one of the daughters of Cecrops, Herse; the sight of her arouses instant passion in the god, who descends to earth in the hope of encountering her. The story ends with the transformation of the envious Aglauros, Herse's sister, into stone. His interpretation of the landscape, particularly the feathered leaves of the trees, the atmospheric depth and the presence of a small classical temple in the background, seems dependent on the brilliant prototypes mentioned above which date between 1610 and 1615.",
    "images/PIAZZA DA LODI, Martino/Madonna and Child with the Infant St John.jpg": "The landscape in the background, and the mysteriousness of the expressions remind us that like so many other works in Lombardy during the first half of the 16th century, this painting could have never been created without the artist being thoroughly familiar with Leonardo's Madonna of the Rocks.",
    "images/ROTARI, Pietro Antonio/Queen Maria Josepha, Wife of King Augustus III of Poland.jpg": "This portrait shows the Queen at the age of 56. Among her exquisite items of jewellery she wears a drop-shaped brilliant in her hair that is held in place by a clip shaped like a black eagle. The miniature portrait on her richly adorned bracelet shows her husband. The painting conforms to the concept of the eloquent portrait; the sitter directs her gaze at the viewer, and her hand points to the portrait of her husband, the picture's pendant.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/2a. Procession of the Queen of Sheba.jpg": "Behind the Queen of Sheba, kneeling in adoration, is her retinue of aristocratic ladies in waiting, with their high foreheads (according to the fashion of the time) emphasizing the round shape of their heads and the cylindrical form of the neck. Their velvet cloaks softly envelop their bodies, reaching all the way to the ground. The almost perfect regularity of the composition is underlined by the two trees in the background, whose leaves hover like umbrellas above the two groups of the women and of the grooms holding the horses.",
    "images/DUJARDIN, Karel/Allegory.jpg": "It shows a lifesize young boy in a blue tunic, blowing bubbles.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Annunciation (3).jpg": "But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. In fact, the relationship of the standing Mary and the kneeling angel is the same in the two representations, although Lippi's style for representing faces is unmistakable and not related to Donatello's classicism of this period.",
    "images/VALCKENBORCH, Frederik van/Mountainous Village Landscape (detail).jpg": "The lower foreground of the painting is abuzz in activity with miners, builders, and water-mill attendants going about their daily duties. In the middle background rests a tavern, a fitting accompaniment to the laborious stations below.",
    "images/LEONARDO da Vinci/Portrait of Cecilia Gallerani (Lady with an Ermine).jpg": "Cecilia Gallerani is holding the heraldic animal of Ludovico il Moro in her arms.

    "images/BASCHENIS, Evaristo/Agliardi Triptych (central).jpg": "The triptych includes portraits of the three brothers and a self-portrait of the artist playing instruments. The central picture of the triptych depicts a still-life with musical instruments: two lutes, cittern, mandola, guitar, spinet. Other represented objects are sheet music, sheets with lute tablatures, cabinet, bowl of apples, carnation, knife, pear. The extraordinary orthogonal of the two lutes and the mandola, leading toward the right, is contrasted in a refined play of crossed and converging diagonals with the sequence formed by the spinet, bowl of apples, and guitar.",
    "images/VALLAYER-COSTER, Anne/Bouquet of Flowers in a Vase.jpg": "Anne Vallayer-Coster depicts this bouquet with great simplicity in a clear vase on a stone ledge, and one stem casually resting on the side. The soft colour harmony of pinks, whites and ochres, velvety petals and tender leaves from this floral arrangement stand out against a dark background with a subtle chiaroscuro.",
    "images/LORENZO Monaco/Diptych Madonna of Humility.jpg": "St Jerome has removed the thorn from the lion's paw, illustrating the monastic virtue of chastity, while the Virgin displays her humility by seating herself on the ground. Here the Virgin is seated not on a throne but on a cushion on the ground.",
    "images/MASTER of the Antwerp Adoration/The Holy Family with Two Saints.jpg": "The Virgin Mary, attired in a blue tunic and a loose-fitting carmine cloak, holds in her lap the naked Baby Jesus, who leans towards a bowl of cherries offered to him by St Catherine, who wears an elegant brocade dress and a rich headdress with precious metal coils. St Joseph, standing behind Mary, humbly takes his hat off while St Barbara, holding an open book in one hand and a peacock feather in the other, beholds the holy group. An angel with wings outspread plays the lute in front of a hybrid building that combines Late Gothic elements with Renaissance decorative features. A beautiful landscape bathed in a bluish light unfolds as a backdrop.",

    "images/FRANCKEN, Hieronymus, II/Still-Life.jpg": "They usually consist of tables covered with all kinds of cutlery, crockery and glassware. These are simple, sober breakfast tables, laid with bread and herring, with a moralizing print on the wall.

    "images/PAOLO VENEZIANO/Monument of Doge Francesco Dandolo.jpg": "In the centre of one of the walls of the Chapter Hall, between the two large windows, is the tomb of the Doge Francesco Dandolo (d. 1339). The Byzantine sarcophagus depicts the death of the Virgin surrounded by the disciples with the Redeemer in the middle carrying Mary's soul in the form of a child in swaddling bands to heaven. The picture depicts St Francis and St Elizabeth of Hungary presenting the Doge Dandolo and the Dogaressa to the Virgin. In the painting the new crisp draperies of the lateral figures are contrasted with the blazing chrome-yellow colouring of the Child's tunic and of the throne cloth and the same fabric patterns. Dandolo and his wife participate in a common space with the central figures and are portrayed on a unified scale; this immediacy and the bright colours dominating the scheme introduce a regal worldliness into the still intensely devotional context.",
    "images/MOILLON, Louise/Still-Life (1).jpg": "This is a still-life with a basket of bitter oranges and pomegranates on a ledge  Louise Moillon as a Protestant was very attached to her community and religion. The pomegranate with its compact seeds under the same peel, symbolizes the Church and the faithful united in the Christian faith.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Madonna of the Magnificat.jpg": "The Virgin Mary, crowned by two angels, is depicted on a throne. Under the guidance of her son, she is writing the canticle \"Magnificat anima mea Dominum\" (My soul doth magnify the Lord), which gives the painting its title. Jesus is sitting in his mother's lap. He is touching a pomegranate, a fruit with many symbolic meanings, and whose red seeds recall the blood shed by Jesus to save humankind. The scene takes place before a window that opens out onto a bright, peaceful country landscape; above, the Serena stone frame creates a division between the kingdom of Heaven and the earth. The religious theme becomes almost temporal in the fashionable, elegant hairstyles of Mary and the angels, who, as in various other works by Botticelli, are without wings. The Virgin's blonde hair with bright gold finish is covered by transparent veils under a richly decorated maphorion, while the hairstyles and clothing of the angels are based on the fashions followed by the scions of the rich Florentine families of the late 15th century.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Rinaldo Abandoning Armida (detail).jpg": "They discover him in Armida's enchanted garden and hold up to him a shield, as a mirror in which he recognizes that he has neglected his duties.

He is preparing to depart with his companions on the left. A ship awaits him in the background.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Scenes with decorative bands (2).jpg": "The decorative bands on the walls above contain several scenes from the Old Testament and busts of saints and prophets.",
    "images/CÉZANNE, Paul/Large Pine near Aix.jpg": "The pine that Cézanne painted several times seems here to be bestowing space with its branches.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/Madonna Enthroned with Saints.jpg": "The saints flanking the Madonna are Andrew and Anthony.",
    "images/JACOBELLO DEL FIORE/Madonna and Child.jpg": "The formal eastern iconography of this subject, depicting the Madonna facing the viewer, holding a stiffly posed and fully clothed child, has been slightly modified by Jacobello. Here, the Madonna, seated on a grassy patch, is slightly turned towards the child with her head inclined to the right. The child, while still fully clothed, reaches out to his mother in a somewhat playful gesture.",
    "images/GOES, Hugo van der/The Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "The picture shows the central panel of the Portinari Triptych. The central panel is flanked by two wings depicting other members of the Portinari family and the family's patron saints, with a grisaille Annunciation on their reverse. While space and anatomy are easily mastered, they are no longer major themes of the composition, The infant Jesus lies within an aureole in an outdoor square, surrounded by his parents, clusters of angels and the worshipping shepherds. Thus the angels in the foreground are surprisingly small in comparison to Mary and Joseph - a contrast repeated in the sizes of the donors and saints portrayed in the wings. Details such as the angels in their copes and the still-life of flowers in the foreground are executed with an exquisite delicacy unsurpassed in the entire painting of the Early Renaissance.",
    "images/MELOZZO DA FORLI/Vaulting decoration of the Sacristy of St Mark (detail).jpg": "The centre of the vaulting in the Sacristy of St mark, with the coat of arms of the cardinal-bishop Girolamo Basso della Rovere, is surrounded by a wreath of heads of putti and hovering angels.",
    "images/AVED, Jacques-André-Joseph/Madame Crozat.jpg": "With her tapestry work and a teapot handy in the background, she might stand as representative of the highest bourgeoisie: sensible, comfortable, industrious.",
    "images/MEDNYÁNSZKY, László/Jan Horak.jpg": "\"Soldier  Head\" shows the head of a simple  person who kills on order. Misguided and bereft of his personal freedom, he suddenly realizes that war makes no sense. The sketch of Ján Horak shows a self-conscious  and headstrong man, the hero of pubs who does not care about laws.",
    "images/SCHIELE, Egon/Portrait of Wally Neuzil.jpg": "This harmoniously composed likeness shows Wally Neuzil with her slightly-lowered head, auburn hair, and oversized, bright blue eyes looking directly at the viewer. The portrait exudes intimacy and tenderness, thus revealing the lovers' closeness.",
    "images/VERNET, Claude-Joseph/View of Avignon.jpg": "This canvas represents a view of Avignon, from the right bank of the Rhône near Villeneuve.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto (1).jpg": "On his eagle, Jupiter swoops down towards Neptune and Pluto, who are standing at the opposite edge of the ceiling, as if he were making the sky light up with a crystal ball.",
    "images/SANO di Pietro/Donna Perna Being Cured on Approaching St Bernardino's Body.jpg": "It shows the paralytic donna Perna, wife of the Aquilean Matteo Petrucci, being cured after approaching the corpse of Saint Bernardino: his body was removed from its coffin by the people of Aquila and displayed in the church for veneration almost exactly six years after the saint's death in the Franciscan convent of Aquila on 20 May 1444.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 38 Scenes from the Life of Christ 22. Ascension (before restoration).jpg": "The picture shows the fresco before the restoration completed in 2002.",
    "images/DAVID, Gerard/Two Movable Wings of An Altarpiece.jpg": "The two panels representing Christ Carrying the Cross, with the Crucifixion (left) and The Resurrection, with the Pilgrims of Emmaus (right) formed the movable wings of an altarpiece. The reverses of the two Passion scenes, displayed when the wings were closed, show the Virgin Annunciate and the Archangel Gabriel, painted in grisaille to emulate sculpture.",
    "images/JACOPO DI CIONE/Noli me tangere (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the figure of Christ appearing to St Mary Magdalene.",
    "images/PINTURICCHIO/The Annunciation (detail) (2).jpg": "What first catches the eye is the shelf just above it, on which books and other objects are arranged in the manner of a still-life. One of the books lies open. The white cloth draped decoratively across the front of the shelf casts a strong shadow on the wall, as do the candle and the wine carafe. These shadows presuppose some source of light from above and to the left, as do those of the two foreground figures.",
    "images/LA TOUR, Georges de/Job Mocked by his Wife.jpg": "There is the same flickering movement that is found in the Payment of Dues, even though there are only two figures. La Tour has concentrated on a dialogue between the unfortunate Job and his ill-tempered wife, and has allowed us a glimpse of a rarely painted subject, a husband tormented by his wife. Her cruel mockery of him comes over with great force as Job sits helplessly contemplating his sores (the potsherd he uses to scrape them is on the ground).",
    "images/LORENZO Monaco/The Annunciation.jpg": "Gabriel is shown flying in this Annunciation scene.",
    "images/BEMBO, Giovan Francesco/Adoration of the Magi and Presentation in the Temple.jpg": "The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion. View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra (1).jpg": "The arrival of Antony and his entourage is staged as an illusionistic vista within a feigned architectural framework. While the sails of the Roman fleet can still be glimpsed in the background, the magnificently costumed figures move off towards Cleopatra's palace in the manner of a triumphal procession. In the foreground, Antony and Cleopatra lead the way, already portrayed as a couple. Tiepolo ironically plays around with different levels of reality by having Antony point to the entrance of the palace, which is at the same time the room in which the viewer stands, and to which the steps in the picture also seem to lead down.",
    "images/GHISLANDI, Giuseppe/Portrait of Giovanni Secco Suardo and his Servant.jpg": "Even when relaxing, which can be deduced from the way his clothes are loosened and the fact that he is not wearing a wig, the nobleman maintains his formal, pompously impressive poise. The wise-looking old man may well only be a servant, but his presence provides an alternative type of dignity to that of the count. He counter-balances the social and intellectual claims of the nobleman with a reminder of the common human virtues which need no titles.",
    "images/SCHOOTEN, Floris Gerritsz. van/Still-Life (1).jpg": "This painting depicts a still-life of cheese, a silver beaker, bread on a pewter dish, butter in a blue-and-white bowl, together with red- and white-currants, a knife and biscuits on a table draped with a green cloth.",

    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Bacchus and Ceres.jpg": "Ceres, the goddess who taught the human race agriculture, is easy to recognize by the shafts of wheat in her hand and in her hair. The juice that Bacchus squeezes from a bunch of grapes is caught in a bowl by Ceres. The pair is surrounded by four additional figures, perhaps the Hours.",
    "images/TILBORGH, Gillis van/Outside a Tavern.jpg": "This painting depicts a scene  with sportsmen and other men and women drinking outside a tavern near the dunes, together with hounds and horsemen.",
    "images/ROELAS, Juan de las/The Martyrdom of St Andrew (detail).jpg": "The figures in the lower part of the picture are especially fine.",
    "images/KEY, Adriaen Thomasz/Portrait of Prince William of Orange.jpg": "This likeness of the prince has become iconic, which is due primarily to the fact that he is not depicted as a warrior or powerful ruler, but rather as a burgher.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Virgin and Child (10).jpg": "The painter featured his favourite pigment, ultramarine, in an exaggerated, complex system of folds for the Virgin's drapery, which extends over nearly a third of the composition. The Child's muscular, expressive body, familiar from other late paintings, must have derived from Italian sources.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Domenico/Minuet in Villa.jpg": "It is an elegant, ironic portrayal of a typical pastime of the nobility while holidaying in their villas.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Self-Portrait at 26.jpg": "The artist's pose is self confident, showing him standing upright and turning slightly to lean his right arm on a ledge. Dürer's figure fills the picture, with his hat almost touching the top. His face and neck glow from the light streaming into the room and his long curly hair is painstakingly depicted. Unlike his earlier self portrait, he now has a proper beard, which was then unusual among young men. His elegant jacket is edged with black and beneath this he wears a white, pleated shirt, embroidered along the neckline. His jaunty hat is striped, to match the jacket. Over his left shoulder hangs a light-brown cloak, tied around his neck with a twisted cord. He wears fine kid gloves. Inside the room is a tall archway, partly framing Dürer's head, and to the right a window opens out onto an exquisite landscape. Green fields give way to a tree-ringed lake and beyond are snow-capped mountains, probably a reminder of Dürer's journey over the Alps three years earlier. Depicting a distant landscape, viewed through a window, was a device borrowed from Netherlandish portraiture. His stylish and expensive costume indicates, like the dramatic mountain view through the window (implying wider horizons), that he considers himself no mere limited provincial.",
    "images/HELST, Bartholomeus van der/The Musician.jpg": "The woman tunes a theorbo-lute, and a viola da gamba rests in front of her.",
    "images/VICTORS, Jan/Town Folk Coming to the Country.jpg": "He contrasts the elegant formality of the townsfolk to the humble earthiness of the villagers.",
    "images/VANNINI, Ottavio/View of the west wall.jpg": "The picture shows the west wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti. It shows Lorenzo the Magnificent with Artists and Virtues (left Prudentia and Abundantia; right Fides).",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Eleonora Gonzaga.jpg": "Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet drape, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window. Titian's landscape is expansive but untraversible, marked by a church tower in its idealized blue distance.",
    "images/VIGÉE-LEBRUN, Élisabeth/Bacchante.jpg": "Crowned with a wreath of grapes and vines, this smiling woman with flushed cheeks represents a bacchante - a follower of the wine god Bacchus.",
    "images/BARTOLOMEO DI GIOVANNI/Predella Presentation at the Temple.jpg": "The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings.",
    "images/RIPPL-RÓNAI, József/Christmas.jpg": "\"Christmas\" shows a complete interior with objects special for Rippl. Dark patches of the picture - Lazarine writing a letter and  the artist's mother, an old woman, about to leave - recall his French \"black\" period. The figure of the old woman is a serious element of the composition as dark patches are important  from the point of view  rhythm. The decorative head kerchief behind the Christmas tree, furniture with striped cover over it, the lively green of the philodendron  and the Christmas decorations flash up to soften the seriousness of the  composition and reflect the atmosphere of  Christmas.",
    "images/UCCELLO, Paolo/Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood (1).jpg": "The base is shown in foreshortening, so as to be seen correctly from below, whereas the warrior in on his horse is drawn in full frontal perspective. The unnatural movement of the horse, which is raising both its right legs at the same time, was pointed out as a serious mistake by Vasari, but it is justified by the consistency of Paolo's perspective construction.",
    "images/RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van/The Dam Square in Amsterdam.jpg": "The Baroque weigh house is to the left of the painting.",
    "images/ORLEY, Bernaert van/Altarpiece of Sts Thomas and Matthew (detail).jpg": "The picture shows the left part of the central panel with the scene of Doubting Thomas.",
    "images/FASOLO, Giovanni Antonio/The Invitation to Dance (1).jpg": "The walls of the Central Hall are decorated with four scenes dedicated to villa life, separated by monochrome figures of giants standing on marble cubes. These giants support the frieze, where putti and heads of the Caesars appear. The four scenes are The Card Game and The Invitation to Dance to the right; The Concert and The Banquet to the left.",
    "images/CAVALLINI, Pietro/Last Judgment (detail) (5).jpg": "Angels, whose bright, colourful feathers stand out against the dark blue ground of the fresco, frame the mandorla. To Christ's right the Virgin stands on a rectangular wooden pedestal; she is dressed in a blue garment under a violet cloak and is turned toward Christ in prayer. Corresponding to her on the other side is John the Baptist, who  is wearing a a violet garment under a brown, fur-lined cloak.",
    "images/MEYTENS, Martin van, II/Empress Maria Theresa.jpg": "The dress of Flemish lace that she is wearing was a gift to her from the states of Flanders.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.jpg": "Even though the young man is obviously being led towards the female allegories of the seven liberal arts, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, grammar, geometry, astronomy and music, it is unclear who is leading him there.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Maestà (detail) (11).jpg": "Above the main picture, a painted arcaded gallery extends both sides of the throne. In its semi-circular arches, half-length figures of Apostles are depicted. The frieze-like line of Christ's disciples gives the impression that they are all looking down  from above on the events, in which two of them - St Peter and St John are taking part. The picture shows the left part of this gallery, the figures are (from the left)",
    "images/PINTURICCHIO/Music.jpg": "The picture shows the personification of Music in the Sala delle Arti in the Appartemento Borgia at the Vatican.",

    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Three Temptations of Christ (detail) (3).jpg": "Among the crowd of people making up the Jewish sacrificial scene, a woman in the left-hand foreground who is carrying on her head a bowl with hens in it strikes us familiar. The posture of the woman carrying wood  in the right-hand foreground (this picture) may also be derived from this picture. In contrast, Botticelli borrowed the small boy holding bunches of grape, and who has been frightened by a snake, from Hellenistic sculpture.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Personification of Hope.jpg": "To the sides of the ceiling in the grand staircase, four large, faux Palladian windows, half-hidden by groupings of clouds, hold two theologian virtues - Hope and Charity - and two cardinal virtues - Justice and Fortitude - all accompanied by their respective attributes. Hope, Charity and Justice are drenched in light, whereas Fortitude is in shadow.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/Panoramic view of the frescoes.jpg": "To either side we see two panoramic scenes of the Crucifixion: the one on the left by Giotto (or the school of Giotto), the one on the right by Pietro Lorenzetti. Cimabue's fresco of the Madonna Enthroned with the Child, St Francis and Four Angels is seen to the left of the nave.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/San Giobbe Altarpiece (detail).jpg": "The Madonna is, as usual, absorbed in her majesty.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The Ancestors of Christ in the Lunettes.jpg": "In the iconographic scheme of the frescoes painted by Michelangelo, the lunettes, together with the eight smaller triangular spandrels, contain the figures of the Ancestors of Christ according to the sequence of forty generations listed at the beginning of the Gospel of Saint Matthew. The names of the ancestors are written in Latin capitals on a tablet placed in the centre of each lunette, at the top of the window arch, on a rectangular fictive slab, painted in dark tones with light green borders. The tablet is enclosed by its own painted bronze frame, resting on a base and consisting of half balusters at the sides; it is surmounted by a small classical female head. The generations of Christ's ancestors are represented in the eight spandrels by family groups and, in the lunettes, by groups or single figures on either side of the tablets.",
    "images/DOSSI, Dosso/The Embrace.jpg": "The subject and the meaning of the picture is unclear, but depicting the tight and apparently forcible embrace by a bestial man (a satyr?), dressed in an animal skin, of a struggling naked woman (a nymph?), the picture seems to allude to the sin of lechery.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Woman Combing Her Hair (1).jpg": "The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind.",
    "images/FRANCIABIGIO/Angel.jpg": "The two flamboyant angels reveal Franciabigio's distinctive lexicon with their proto-Baroque sensibility and deep pathos painted in excited, jagged contours, combined with the strong raking light and almost smoldering atmosphere.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/St Barbara.jpg": "Van Eyck depicts Saint Barbara with her prayer-book and palm, seated before a late-gothic tower which is in the process of construction.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Loggia of Psyche (1).jpg": "The frescoes represent the Story of Psyche, a myth derived from the Golden Ass of Apuleius (2nd century A. D.). Treating the room as a pergola, he designed the two large ceiling pictures that simulate tapestries stretched across the roof. These huge awnings were painted so ingeniously that we can see the straps holding them in place and the scalloped edges they create by stretching the material. The cycle of pictures appears only on the ceiling. Raphael designed a view out onto a brilliant blue sky, in which half-naked figures - either hovering or standing on clouds - merge into an erotically charged scene. The simulated tapestries depict two scenes: the gods deciding to subject Psyche to various tests, and Psyche holding a magnificent banquet to celebrate her acceptance into the circle of the Immortals.",
    "images/MEDNYÁNSZKY, László/View of Dunajec.jpg": "Time seems to stop, everything is reserved and quiet. Natural forces apparent in the picture and the sunshine glimmering through the fog are responsible for the mystic atmosphere.",
    "images/CRESPI, Giuseppe Maria/Apotheosis of Hercules and the Four Seasons.jpg": "Accompanied by Abundantia, Chronos, and the Horae, Hercules is speeding toward the Olympus on a triumphal chariot drawn by four horses. The figure of Hercules is so small and so distant that the viewer only notices him on second glance. Far more prominent and appealing are the personifications of the Four Seasons, which loom up out of the projecting cornice in the centres of the four sides in such a way that their feet are obscured. The gold-black cornice, with its three-dimensional corner cartouches, serves as a picture frame in which an inner surround of painted architecture enlivened by putti creates an imaginary oval opening.",
    "images/TROY, François de/Portrait of an Elegant Woman.jpg": "The woman is presented in a red draped interior opening onto a formal garden accented with a dramatic flowing fountain. She is dressed in opulent silk and brocade and rests her arm over the gilded mask handle of a flower-filled urn. The man on the other hand is presented in the darkened interior of a library, again draped in flowing silk and his hand points to the page of an opened book.",
    "images/LIEVENS, Jan/Bearded Old Man with a Brown Cloak.jpg": "This character study of the head of a bearded man is particularly notable for its refined flesh tones and the subtlety of the colouring.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Immaculate Conception.jpg": "In an awe-inspiring, powerful manifestation, the Virgin Mary hovers in the skies, atop a globe, and in front of a yellow background. Above her the dove appears, symbolizing the Holy Spirit. The palm tree in the foreground is a symbol of Mary's victory and superiority over evil in the world, the snake under her feet stands for original sin. The crescent moon refers to the Woman of the Apocalypse in St John's Gospel and is also a symbol of chastity.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ancestors of Christ figures (detail) (2).jpg": "It assumed that the boy represents Salmon.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron (detail) (3).jpg": "On the right-hand side of the fresco, the revolt of the Jews against Moses is related, the latter portrayed as an old man with a long white beard, clothed in a yellow robe and an olive-green cloak. The classical ruins in the background, while still largely visible in Botticelli's day, are completely destroyed nowadays.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Portrait of Doge Girolamo Priuli.jpg": "Zigzag brushstrokes indicate the eyebrows, red dots of colour in the corners of the eyes, and very fine highlights on the pupils bring the sitters gaze to life. The edge of the white fabric cap or rensa, shown as a wavy line, suggests the narrow fit and pressure of the cornu, the Doge's cap, and thus, indirectly, of his office.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Extraction of St Ignatius' Heart.jpg": "The picture shows the sixth predella panel of the St Barnaba Altarpiece.",
    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/Scenes from a Christian woman's life (detail).jpg": "In the Cubiculum of the Velatio, scenes from a Christian woman's life are represented: marriage, childbirth, death. For each scene of her life a woman in a veil is depicted: being married by a bishop (left), seated in a chair nursing her newborn baby (right) and pose of prayer (orant) to represent her soul as it rises up to heaven (centre). The picture shows the Orant in the centre.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Supper at Emmaus (1).jpg": "Scenes taken from the life of Jesus, quiet episodes of his youth, his preaching and the deeds of his early manhood, and his resurrection form the main subject of the biblical representations. Now he is the resurrected Christ whose tender presence fills the room. Without any commotion, Rembrandt convinces us that we are witnessing the moment when the eyes of the pilgrims are no longer 'held, that they should not recognize him'.",
    "images/STRIGEL, Bernhard/Portrait of a Lady.jpg": "This portrait represents a lady, bust-length, in a gold embroidered black dress and a white headdress, holding a sprig of nightshades and forget-me-nots. She holds a sprig of forget-me-nots (as does the sitter in the Hofer portrait) and bittersweet nightshade, the former the traditional signifier of remembrance, while the latter though more ambiguous in its meaning is also included as a decorative motif on her dress.",
    "images/MEDIEVAL SCULPTOR, Italian/Ambo (detail).jpg": "The wide open eyes of the fantastic lion, regular in size and almost human, and those of the deacon acting as a lectern, seem to want to mesmerize believers.",
    "images/BASSEN, Bartholomeus van/A Church Interior.jpg": "The painting represents a church interior with a beggar seated beneath a pillar and dogs playing in the foreground.",
    "images/DOMENICO VENEZIANO/St John the Baptist and St Francis.jpg": "The two full-length figures are shown under a trompe l'oeil barrel vault; they are very similar, both in form and in the pale colour tones, to the figures of John and Francis in the Magnoli Altarpiece, except that they are much more solidly modelled and the drawing is stronger, elements that most art historians attribute to the influence of Castagno's painting.",
    "images/PORDENONE/Carrying the Cross.jpg": "The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion. Above each arch there is just one broad field in which he painted Pilate Judges Christ; Carrying the Cross; Christ Nailed to the Cross. The narrative folds into the wall of the façade, where the trilogy of the procession to Calvary comes to a close in the enormous fresco of the Golgotha by Pordenone.",
    "images/MÉNAGEOT, François-Guillaume/Lady Nursing Her Child.jpg": "The the figure in this genre scene, depicting a lady nursing her child in a drawing room, is said to be the wife of the  painter Henri-Pierre Danloux (1753-1809).",
    "images/REDON, Odilon/The Triumphal Car of Apollo.jpg": "The sun-god Apollo, who was nicknamed \"the shining one,\" is not directly visible himself in the picture but is probably understood to be present in the beam of light on the right-hand edge of the picture. The reflection of this light on the horses pulling his chariot conveys its intensity.",
    "images/VIVARINI, Bartolomeo/St Roch and the Angel.jpg": "This work is noted for its landscape which acts as a backdrop to the lively figures of the saint and the angel, painted on a golden background.",
    "images/VANNINI, Ottavio/Michelangelo Showing Lorenzo il Magnifico the Head of a Faun (1).jpg": "It shows Lorenzo the Magnificent among the artists and writers of his time.",
    "images/MASTER of Flémalle/St Veronica.jpg": "This side panel represents St Veronica who holds the cloth marked with the face of Christ, while the other the standing figure of Virgin Mary who suckles the infant Christ. In the background of the side panels the artist uses a background of brocade hangings to produce a space without depth. The third panel, probably from the reverse side of the retable, represents the Holy Trinity in grisaille: God the Father supports the dead Christ and shows the body to the whole community; the Holy Spirit is present in the form of a dove. St Veronica appears delicate and psychologically isolated in her emotion. The lower part of the figure, where her clothes are gathered into elegant folds, is three-dimensional, but around the shoulders it is made to look comparatively flat, so as not to stand out too much from the entirely non-spatial, strongly patterned brocade of the background. The folds of her garments form patterns and matching correspondences, for instance where the end of her green sleeve on the right is echoed by the end of the red cloak hanging to the ground. Veronica is standing on a comparatively deep piece of natural ground that ends against a flat and entirely unrealistic wall that seems very close to the figure at the top, thus the illusion of a shrine or niche is given. In other words the saint is displayed as if in a carved shrine.",
    "images/PARMIGIANINO/Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale, Count of Fontanellato.jpg": "The count stares out at the viewer, calmly daring anyone to challenge his innate physical and intellectual superiority. In his right hand he displays a bronze medal marked with the mysterious ciphers \"7\" and \"2\", which must have had significance for him and his close circle of friends, but whose inscrutability serves to distance him from the rest of humanity.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Annunciation (2).jpg": "But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. In fact, the relationship of the standing Mary and the kneeling angel is the same in the two representations, although Lippi's style for representing faces is unmistakable and not related to Donatello's classicism of this period.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/A Woman Asleep at Table (detail) (3).jpg": "To the right is the back of a chair, and in the distance a half-open door that allows the viewer to see into another room.",
    "images/CORNELIS VAN HAARLEM/The Fall of Man (detail).jpg": "The animals are carefully arranged. The monkey embracing the cat, the dog and the fox, the slug and the owl all have connotations that comment on the story.",

    "images/DOSSI, Dosso/Madonna and Child.jpg": "Dosso Dossi, the great Ferrarese master, belongs to a different world of mysterious and courtly fairy tales set in fantastic wild landscapes, with the addition of elements derived from northern European painting. Dossi's small Madonna and Child illustrates the perfect relationship between figures and nature: the golden rays from the halos are echoed in the leaves of the trees and the same shades of blue and green which modulate the Madonna's mantle are to be found in the different elements of the landscape.",
    "images/NOMÉ, François de/Belisarius Recognized by one of his Soldiers.jpg": "The painting shows a scene - Belisarius is recognized by one of the soldiers who served under him. The painter emphasizes the architectural setting (a stage set) and the light effects.",
    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Wheat Field with Crows.jpg": "Critics tend fairly unanimously to detect a sense of menace in the dark birds flying from the horizon towards the foreground. The whole mood of darkness is reinforced by the stormy sky, which supplies so powerful a contrast to the yellow wheat.",
    "images/RYSSELBERGHE, Théo van/The Man at the Helm.jpg": "His painting shows a helmsman who is under way with his ship in high seas. The sail takes up the upper left-hand corner, the man at the helm the lower right.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (detail) (2).jpg": "With forceps in his right hand Tulp holds the muscles and tendons of the arm that control the movement of the hand, while the bent fingers of his left hand demonstrate an aspect of their wondrous action.",

    "images/DALSGAARD, Christen/Surely He Will Come.jpg": "The picture features a young woman standing in an open doorway looking off to one side. One foot is on the door frame, and one foot is on the ground outside. The interior is dark and shadowed. The outside is a sunlit agrarian landscape.",

    "images/BLOEMAERT, Abraham/The Emmaus Disciples.jpg": "The tableau presents the biblical scene in which Jesus - in a gesture that refers back to the Last Supper - breaks bread and in so doing confirms his resurrection from the dead to two of his disciples, who had not recognised him until then (Luke 24, 13-35). Two figures in the background represent the same two disciples, despairingly consulting with each other on the road to the village of Emmaus, before meeting the \"stranger\" who was to open their eyes for good. The visible emotional reactions which the revelation causes to the protagonists are seemingly totally lost on a fourth individual, a turbaned server.",

    "images/LUYCKX, Christiaen/Still-Life (2).jpg": "The present still-life of lemons, grapes and peaches with a bread roll and a silver pokal on a partly draped table reveals this influence.",
    "images/SPINELLO ARETINO/St Benedict Recognizes the Sword Bearer Riggo Disguised as King Totila.jpg": "Scene 14 on the east wall shows when St Benedict recognizes the sword bearer Riggo disguised as King Totila. Totila, king of the Goths, announces his visit to the monastery. He does not, however, enter himself but rather sends his sword bearer, Riggo, disguised as the king and accompanied by a royal retinue, in order to test whether Benedict actually possesses the gift of prophesy, as had been reported. The saint immediately sees through this attempted deception.",
    "images/WITTEL, Caspar Andriaans van/View of Rome.jpg": "The canvas depicts a view of the Tiber near the bastions of Castel Sant'Angelo. At the left is the Palazzo Altoviti and part of the Fiorentini Quay; in the background one can see the Santo Spirito bell-tower and the building of the Ospedale dei Pazzi. Visible at the right is the cupola of St. Peter's basilica.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Soldiers between columns.jpg": "This scene is on the left wall of the vestibule, opposite the Sacrifice of Iphigenia.",
    "images/TOCQUÉ, Louis/Portrait of Empress Elizabeth.jpg": "After a few sittings sin the palace, the artist produced a living image of Elizabeth, who is shown with the attributes of the monarchy: the orb and sceptre, as well as the badge and sash of the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/10. Annunciation (detail).jpg": "From up in heaven the Eternal Father, seen in half-length, stretches out his arms sending down the Holy Spirit in the form of golden rays of light. The Lord is represented as a good, white-haired old man, similar to King Chosroes: the head, in fact, was made using the same cartoon.",
    "images/RUYSDAEL, Salomon van/Ferry near Gorinchem.jpg": "In the left background of this typical river view by Salomon van Ruysdael, the three-story Sint Jans Tower of the Grote Kerk in Gorinchem (or Gorkum) is visible. The entire foreground is devoted to vignettes of local travel. Two boats have pulled up at a steep bank, which is provided with a ladder. In the boat with two large fishing baskets astern, the owner gestures with hat to heart. At the inn, a rider addresses local folk at the door. The rendering of the architecture in the area of the mills and ramparts in the right background, seems to be faithful to judge from contemporary panoramic drawings of Gorinchem by other artists.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Man with a Magnifying Glass.jpg": "The man wears an imaginary version of early sixteenth-century dress, which is lent an Italian flavour by its rich colouring and voluminous sleeves. The object held by the man appears to be a \"thread-counter,\" which was a lens used to examine samples of cloth.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/View of the nave from the east (1).jpg": "The Upper Church, with its single nave and tall Gothic windows, has a bright and festive atmosphere.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Miraflores Altarpiece (detail).jpg": "The scene on the right panel is the only one in this altarpiece that illustrates two events at once: in the foreground we see Christ appearing to the Virgin Mary, while in the background we can see the immediately preceding event, His resurrection on Easter morning. The winding road from the tomb to the building in the foreground makes it clear that Christ went to his mother at once, so that she would be the first to experience the joy of reunion with him.",
    "images/MARIESCHI, Michele/Capriccio of a Riverside Town.jpg": "The painting represents a capriccio of an imagined cityscape with Saint Mark's Basilica and ruins on the banks of a river. This imagined riverside town is typical of the spirited and picturesque landscapes created early in the career of Michele Marieschi. The artist includes celebrated and instantly recognizable edifices, such as Venice's Saint Mark's Basilica here, and places them side by side with fantasy buildings and crumbling ruins. The artist is not bound by rules of perspective: the ruined columns and the tower overgrown with greenery are painted to a completely different scale than the houses directly opposite them on the other side of the river at right. They dwarf the figures beneath them, who cross the bridge between the two sides.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/St Martin Renounces his Weapons (scene 4).jpg": "In this fresco we see Martin, as an officer in the Roman army face to face with the enemy, announcing his decision: \"I am a soldier of Christ and I cannot fight.\" To the left, the Roman camp, with Emperor Julian, a group of soldiers and the treasurer distributing money to the mercenaries. To the right, waiting for the battle, behind the hill, the barbarian army with their armour and their spears. Martin (still a knight, but carrying a cross and shown in the act of blessing) is looking towards the Emperor but walking towards the enemy. His battle is the struggle against paganism, and his only weapon is the word of Christ.",
    "images/MAGNASCO, Alessandro/The Observant Friars in the Refectory.jpg": "He depicted imaginary scenes, capriccios in many of which monks are seen in strange settings or tiny figures in stormy landscapes.",
    "images/SORGH, Hendrick Maertensz/An Interior Scene.jpg": "The painting depicts an interior scene with two peasants eating herrings and drinking.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Samson and Delilah.jpg": "The surface of Delilah's bed receded to a properly horizontal plane, with the space of the room leading convincingly back to the wall and the door through which the Philistine soldiers enter to capture the hapless Jewish hero. To the multiple light sources in this room, for which Rubens was indebted to his friend Elsheimer - the flaming brazier, the candle held by the old procuress and the torch of the Philistines - we must add in our mind's eye a fire blazing in the fireplace below, highlighting the saffron satin throw behind Delilah and the patterned Oriental rug, and casting warm reflections in the shadows of the skin tones and the white drapery, where the coarse brown hatching of the underpaint is left uncovered or barely veiled. Bribed by his Philistine enemies, she cozens Samson into revealing the source of his supernatural strength: his uncut hair. As he lies asleep in her lap during a night of love, she calls in a barber to cut off `the seven locks of his head'. Her profile juxtaposed with that of the youthful harlot both reveals her own past and suggests Delilah's future. A statue of Venus and Cupid presides over the erotic scene. In Delilah's breast band Rubens draws on Roman marbles, but following his own maxim translates marble into soft and yielding flesh - some of the fleshiest ever painted.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Madonna of the Harpies (detail).jpg": "The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child, lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/A Woman Asleep at Table (detail) (2).jpg": "The painter shows us in the left part of the composition a table covered with a glowing Oriental rug pulled up in front. On it is a Delftware plate with fruit, a white pitcher, and an overturned glass or roemer in the foreground.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve (`The Ambassadors').jpg": "On our left stands Jean de Dinteville, a French nobleman posted to London as ambassador. The globe on the bottom shelf shows Polisy, where he had his château; the ornate sheath of the dagger in his right hand gives his age as 29. To his left stands his friend and fellow-countryman, Georges de Selve, whose visit to London in 1533 is commemorated here. He leans his elbow on a book inscribed with his age: 25. In their attire, their poses and their bearing the two friends exemplify, respectively, the active and the contemplative life, which, together, complement each other. On the top shelf, the minutely rendered `Turkey' carpet bears a celestial globe and an array of astronomical and navigational instruments. The cylindrical dial gives the date as 11 April; the polyhedral dial on the right indicates two different times of day. In front of the terrestrial globe on the lower shelf lies a German text-book of Arithmetic for Merchants, propped open with a T-square. But a string of the lute has snapped, a traditional emblem of fragility. Just visible in the top left corner, at the edge of the magnificently patterned green hanging, is a crucifix. The hymnal in front of the lute is open at Martin Luther's hymn,'Come Holy Ghost our souls inspire'. Across the mosaic floor - derived from the medieval pavement in Westminster Abbey - there spreads a curious shape between the two friends. It is a skull, skilfully distorted so that its true form can only be perceived from the correct viewpoint at the edges of the panel.",
    "images/URBANI, Andrea/Ceiling fresco.jpg": "The Room of the Astrea is named after the winged female deity on the ceiling, who is surrounded by putti and symbolizes the morning star. The picture shows the ceiling with representation of Astrea at the centre.",

    "images/TINTORETTO/The Conversion of Saul.jpg": "This large canvas shows the conversion of Saul, formerly a persecutor of Christians and later known as Paul, when he was flung to the ground by a bright light on his way to Damascus, blinded, and addressed by the loud voice of God.",
    "images/DAVID, Gerard/The Nativity.jpg": "In the Nativity the shepherds, ungainly in their clumsy boots, look as if they scarcely dare to approach the Infant (the figure in the background opening is usually believed to be a self-portrait) and the streets and houses of the town in the background are depicted with the detailed clarity of a topographer.",

    "images/MEYTENS, Martin van, II/Self-Portrait.jpg": "The Budapest self-portrait belongs to a later period, and shows a slightly changed, somewhat more corpulent man. His face is still youthfully smooth, but already fattish, and he wears an Allonge-wig. A gold chain on his breast holds the medal he got in 1730 from Frederic, King of Sweden during his activity in Stockholm, and he ostentatiously shows with his right hand the medallion portrait of Empress Maria Theresa.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Ceiling paintings on the Landtmann side.jpg": "While the cycle of paintings in the right staircase represents the evolution of the theatre and three classical playwrights, the left-hand side focuses on the themes of music, dance, medieval mystery plays and the extempore stage. All the scenes depict actors together with their audiences. The cycle in the left-hand staircase (on the Landtmann side) consists of the \"Altar of Apollo\", \"Ancient Ex-Tempore Actor\" (Franz Matsch), \"The Theatre at Taormina\" (Gustav Klimt), \"Medieval Mystery Play\" (Franz Matsch) and \"Clown on a Fairground Stage\" (Ernst Klimt).",

    "images/FOGGINI, Giambattista/Elector Palatine's cabinet.jpg": "The accent is of course on the portrait of the Elector Palatine, carved in chalcedon, dressed in gilded bronze armour and seated on the military trophies that symbolise martial virtues, in a coiled pose that brings dynamism to the whole structure. Above, he is praised by the allegories of Magnanimity and Strength, located to the sides of the Medici emblem quartered with that of the German prince, while at the top, a triumph of arms with heraldic symbols and the motto Dominus virtutum nobiscum (The Lord of the armies is with us), held by putti that return into two symmetrically placed rounds on the sides, hidden by doors, covered with mirrors and accessorised by small but genuine crystal chandeliers.",
