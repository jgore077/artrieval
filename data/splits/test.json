    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/Fractio panis (3).jpg": "The scene represents seven persons at a table, six men and a woman. Six of these are reclining as the ancients reclined at their meals. But the seventh person, a bearded figure, sits somewhat apart at the extremity of the table. His head is thrown back, he has a small loaf or cake in his hands, and his arms stretched out in front of him show that he is breaking it. Upon the table immediately before him is a two-handled cup. Further along the table there are two large plates, one containing two fishes, the other five loaves. At each extremity of the picture upon either side we notice baskets filled with loaves — four baskets at one end, three at the other.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Rehoboam - Abijah (detail) (1).jpg": "The young man at right is seated bent forward in an attitude of complete abandon. His head, with his face turned toward the wall, is resting on the hand placed on his right knee; his other arm hangs down at his side. Behind him, a young boy seems to be trying to make him sit upright by grabbing his shoulder. The juxtapositions of bright colours in the woman's clothes - a green scarf over her head and shoulders, a violet-rose pinafore, a reddish-orange mantle with yellow ocher lining - are matched by equally rich, but more delicate, tones in those of the young man.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/St John Taking Leave of His Parents.jpg": "The picture shows one of the scenes from the Stories from the Life of St John the Baptist painted by Filippo Lippi in the choir of the Prato Cathedral.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Aged Oriental with a Young Woman.jpg": "This oval painting is on the left of the main picture (Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices) on the ceiling of the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci in the Palazzo Ducale. The subject of the picture is not known, the modern name being just for convenience. The bearded old man, sunk in thought on the ruins of ancient architecture, may have reminded Palma of pictures of classical philosophers.",
    "images/GIULIO ROMANO/View of the Sala dei Giganti (south and west walls).jpg": "The walls and the ceiling of the room are painted with a single continuous scene of giant figures. The room's decoration represents Jupiter punishing the giants for having dared to oppose his power and for bringing their rebellion to his domain. The giants are attacking the gods, trying to storm Olympus, piling mountain onto mountain, until Jupiter causes the boulders to fall with his lightning, and the attackers are buried beneath them. From the summit of Mount Olympus, the father of the gods hurls his thunderbolts at the earth, sweeping away the giants and the awkward pile of rocks intended to support their ascent into the heavens. The pantheon of pagan divinities that surround him are for the most part paralysed with fear. The giants are ill-proportioned but muscular, with grotesque, desperate faces, and they are depicted struggling amid or trying to escape the dramatic collapse of rocks and fictive architecture that Giulio Romano imagined.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Grand Canal, Looking East from the Campo San Vio (detail).jpg": "Canaletto has included a curious detail: a depiction of a boat on the wall of the building in the right foreground. Above it a woman looks down from a small balcony; Canaletto placed similar figures at the edge of a number of his pictures, in order to close off the scene.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Austrian/Mary of Burgundy.jpg": "The picture shows Mary, Duchess of Burgundy (1457-1482), the first wife of Archduke Maximilian of Austria, later Holy Roman Emperor. The monogram on the reverse shows the superimposed letters AH or HA and the date 1528 which was already present when the image of the Virgin was added in the late seventeenth or the eighteenth century.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/St Christopher.jpg": "His red cloak bunched up behind him, the giant Christopher staggers across the river, with the Christ Child on his back. The hermit stands at the edge of the water at lower right, but his treehouse has been transformed into a broken jug which houses a devilish tavern; above, a naked figure scrambles up a branch towards a beehive, a symbol of drunkenness. Across the river, a dragon emerges from a ruin, frightening a swimmer, while a town blazes in the shadowy distance.",
    "images/PLEYDENWURFF, Hans/Resurrection of the Hof Altarpiece.jpg": "The Resurrection is the supreme miracle, when Jesus triumphs over death.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/The Norfolk Triptych (left wing).jpg": "The two wings in Brussels represent the donors of a triptych, the central panel of which, conserved at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, shows a Virgin and Child. Probably man and wife, they are kneeling on \"prie-dieus\". She is looking to the left and has her hands joined, he is looking at the viewer and is holding a psalter. The couple is richly dressed - a distinctive sign of its high social position - but also soberly. The donatrix is enveloped in a white veil and wears a black, lined robe with red braiding and sleeves, revealing a slightly transparent chemisette, and with a fur thrown over her shoulders. The donor wears a fur-lined coat, a brown jacket and a white shirt with a finely embroidered collar.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/The Seven Sacraments II Marriage.jpg": "Here everything is dense and taut; grays dominate a dark architectural setting from which occasional red and yellows glow impressively. Only Marriage with its garlands  and luminous windows, displays any lightheartedness.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Last Judgment (detail) (6).jpg": "The figure of Christ is also framed on the left and right by enthroned apostles.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Crucifixion.jpg": "The represented saint are, from the left, St Monica, St Augustine, the Virgin, an unidentified saint (perhaps St Catherine of Alexandria), St Magdalen, St John the Evangelist, St Jerome, and St John the Baptist.",
    "images/IRIARTE, Ignacio de/Landscape with Figures.jpg": "This landscape of dark tonality is in fact a hunting scene with water-fowls, the hunter's boat is approaching in the bottom right corner of the painting.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/The Birth of Venus (detail) (3).jpg": "Zephyrus, the God of Winds, and the breeze Aura are endeavouring to blow the Goddess of Love ashore. There, Venus is being received by one of the Horae, Goddesses of the Seasons, who is spreading out a robe for her. The flowers which embellish the garments distinguish this Hora as the Goddess of Spring.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Prophets and Sibyls.jpg": "In this compartment of the right wall, on the left the prophets Isaiah, Moses, Daniel, David, Jeremiah, and Solomon are represented. On the right the Eritrean, Persian, Cumaean, Libyan, Tiburtine, and Delphian sibyls are depicted. Above, God the Father in a gloriole surrounded by angels can be seen.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Virgin and Child Enthroned with Two Angels.jpg": "The composition itself is most closely related to the Virgin Enthroned in Berlin, which also takes place in a room with two windows and a stone throne with volute armrests. The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone. The sculpture that tops the throne represents the archangel expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.",
    "images/JONSON VAN CEULEN, Cornelius the Elder/Portrait of a Man.jpg": "The Portrait of a Man, and its pendant, the Portrait of a Woman, were painted by the artist in Amsterdam.",
    "images/WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine/Jupiter and Antiope.jpg": "She was surprised by Jupiter in the form of a Satyr while she was asleep, and was ravished by him.",
    "images/PLEYDENWURFF, Hans/Count Georg von Löwenstein (right wing).jpg": "The half-length portrait shows the elderly donor holding his thumb in a devotional book, apparently ruminating on its meaning. He rests on a parapet in strong light against a dark background. On the left wing of the diptych Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows.",
    "images/CHASSÉRIAU, Théodore/The Artist's Sisters.jpg": "The painting portrays Marie-Antoinette, called Adèle (1810-1869), and Geneviève, called Aline (1822-1871), sisters of the painter.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 22 Scenes from the Life of Christ 6. Christ among the Doctors (before restoration).jpg": "The picture shows the fresco before the restoration completed in 2002.",
    "images/WEIR, Julian Alden/The Red Bridge.jpg": "The bridge, its colour contrasting strongly with natural setting, opens up decorative possibilities when seen together with its reflection - two diagonals running in at an angle to each other.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Madonna and Child with Saints.jpg": "The represented saints are Catherine and the young John the Baptist. The figures are placed well to the foreground, juxtaposed against the wooded background.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Portrait of a Young Woman (1).jpg": "The punctilious attention to detail expressed in the tiny decorations of the dress, the tight curly hair and the effervescent hat  tells us that this is a fine example of German artistic workmanship.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/St George Fighting the Dragon.jpg": "Saint George happened to be riding by and, seeing the maiden in tears, commended himself to God and transfixed the dragon with his spear. St George's lance has been broken in the struggle, but the proud knight is about to vanquish the dragon with the sword, and so free the princess, who is fleeing on the right.",
    "images/PRE-ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French/Figures around a Saint.jpg": "Set within another tympanum, we are confronted by another unusual composition: depicted along the central axis is the upright figure of a saint around whom the other figures are grouped in such a way that they form a line rising up towards the centre.",
    "images/L'ESTIN, Jacques de/Self-portrait.jpg": "On the northern edge of Burgundy, but actually in Champagne, stood the medieval city of Troyes, where the Rome-trained Jacques de L'Estin worked.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: \"This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.\" The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. Ghirlandaio's landscape in the background also displays features from north of the Alps.",
    "images/FANTIN-LATOUR, Henri/Corner of the Table.jpg": "In this still-life the painter shows a bouquet of flowers without showing the vase or pot in which it stands.",
    "images/STRANOVER, Tobias/Birds in a Landscape.jpg": "This painting is unusual in showing a rural landscape with ploughed fields and a farmhouse. It depicts a great curassow, silver pheasant, golden pheasant and other birds.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/View of the room of Virgil.jpg": "The scenes in this room are Mercury Appearing to Aeneas, Aeneas Introducing Cupid Dressed as Ascanius to Dido (scenes shown in the present photo), Venus Appearing to Aeneas on the Shores of Carthage, and Aeneas Encounters His Mother, Venus, in the Form of a Huntress.",
    "images/FUSELI, John Henry/The Nightmare (2).jpg": "The figure of the woman lying asleep or unconscious is extremely elongated and distorted, not because Fuseli could do no better, but in order to visualize the horrible oppressiveness of the gnome crouched on the woman's breast, a nightmare and incarnation of unconscious terrors. In the gap between the curtains in the background appears the ghostly head of a blind horse, which anticipates the demoniac aspect given this animal especially in later French Romanticism.",
    "images/MORONI, Giovanni Battista/Portrait of a Gentleman (1).jpg": "This painting shows the portrait of an unidentified gentleman with his helmet on a column shaft which may symbolise the sitter's fortitude or, since it is broken, his misfortunes.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Nahshon (detail).jpg": "The woman is depicted standing, with one foot resting on the stone seat, looking at herself in an oval mirror that she is holding in her hand, her elbow resting on the knee of her raised leg. Her back and head are bent forward, following the curve of the top edge of the lunette. She is wearing a green overdress, tied over the shoulders, and a rose blouse with rose-orange shadows. The complex style of her blond hair, knotted on the top of her head, from where a long ponytail hangs, emphasizes her clean-cut profile and the delicate passages of light and shade on her neck, on which a gold earring stands out.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/Apotheosis of St Ursula.jpg": "The complexity of the perspective foreshortening of the marble aedicula, of the furled banners, of the figure of Ursula surrounded by angels and with God the Father looking down at her, is far too self-conscious and still too close to the style of Mantegna to be the work of the established artist active around 1510.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Eve (detail) (1).jpg": "At the far left and right of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round.",
    "images/NARDO DI CIONE/View of the frescoes.jpg": "It presents on two sides vaulted arches lowered on octagonal fourteenth century pillars with overlying gallery, supported by very projecting corbels, leading from the dormitory to the sacristy of the church. It opens on it the funeral chapel of the Strozzis with two walls painted with the Nativity and the Crucifixion, attributed to Andrea Orcagna or his school.",
    "images/STEENWIJCK, Harmen/Still-Life of Fruit and Dead Fowl.jpg": "Their tables piled with fruit, birds, fish, and unpretentious kitchen ware would be assigned to the Rotterdam school if their authors were unknown.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/The Four Holy Men (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the head of St Mark.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Last Judgment Triptych.jpg": "The central panel of the triptych represents the Last Judgment and the Seven Deadly Sins. The interior view of the left wing depicts the Fall of the Rebel Angels, Creation of Eve, Fall of Man and Expulsion, while the interior view of the right wing shows Hell and the Prince of Darkness. The majority of mankind has been engulfed in the universal cataclysm which rages throughout the deep, murky landscape below. This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as Dürer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: \"Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes\". The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background. In any event, earth has become indistinguishable from Hell, depicted on the right wing, out of which the army of Satan swarms to attack the damned; the eternity of torment has begun. The avaricious are boiled in the great cauldron just visible beneath one of the buildings in the central panel. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead. The lascivious woman on the roof above suffers the attentions of a lizard-like monster slithering across her loins, while being serenaded by two musical demons. On the cliffs to the right, across the river, blacksmith-devils hammer other victims on anvils, and one is being shod like a horse; these unfortunate souls are guilty of the sin of anger.",
    "images/CERESA, Carlo/The Vision of St Felix of Cantalice.jpg": "The patron's wrinkled face and long beard appear so truthful and alive that they project a shadow onto the parapet in the foreground that separates the divine space from the earthbound. The artist's realism is evident not only in the portrait of the donor but also in the face of the Virgin, based on that of Ceresa's wife, and of the sullen cherub on the right, for which their seven-year-old son was probably the model.",
    "images/JANSSENS, Hieronymus/The Prodigal Son.jpg": "Here we are offered a glimpse of his lavish lifestyle before falling into penury.",
    "images/MASTER of the Trebon Altarpiece/The Resurrection.jpg": "The risen Christ has floated through and out of the closed and sealed tomb. We are shown not the moment of resurrection, but the state of being resurrected. The painter presents the event as a true miracle. The watchmen fix their eyes on the apparition as if entranced.",
    "images/URBANI, Andrea/View of a Villa with a Pool.jpg": "The decoration of the portego is limited to the walls, on which there are three large landscapes set within ornate, faux architectural settings, also designed by Urbani. The west wall contains View of a Villa with a Pool and Landscape with Waterfall, while the opposite wall has View of a Large Renaissance Palace, divided into two parts by the staircase door. In the centre foreground of each landscape, on a trompe-l'oeil pedestal, is a faux-bronze statuary group representing the struggle between Good and Evil.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Boreas Abducting Oreithyia.jpg": "He is old and has flowing grey locks and wings. He is shown flying away with the naked girl clasped firmly in his hands. Putti are present playing with snowballs.",
    "images/CAMPI, Vincenzo/Kitchen.jpg": "Similar to the market stall, they often show tables and sideboards with clusters of baskets and bowls full of fruit and vegetables. While market stalls illustrate the commercialisation of agriculture and the principle of agro-economic production, kitchen and pantry paintings are dominated by the aspect of satisfying the needs of domestic economy, usually in a feudal or re-feudalized upper middle class household.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Deposition.jpg": "The picture shows an early example of the works of Romanist painters (Northern artists influenced by Italian Renaissance painting).",
    "images/LOTZ, Károly/Spring, Portrait of Ilona Lippich.jpg": "The charming, youthful figure is dressed is white, she bolds a colourful bouquet of wild flowers in her hand.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Scenes from the Life of the Virgin.jpg": "The scenes of the cycle consist of the Birth of the Virgin in the lunette opposite the entrance, above the altar; the Presentation and the Marriage of the Virgin, combined in the right lunette; the Angel of the Annunciation and the Virgin Annunciate in the left lunette, and the Visitation, above the entrance to the chapel. Represented in the cupola is God the Father in a glory of angels, a traditional complement to the Annunciation group. The Birth of the Virgin is set in a sixteenth-century domestic interior, with a beamed ceiling, a bottle-glass window, a Savonarola chair, and maidservants in contemporary dress.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Cato.jpg": "On the entry wall Cato is depicted. At right the compartment on the left wall with Famous Men can be seen.",

    "images/DAVID, Jacques-Louis/Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon I (detail) (3).jpg": "At the left are two of Napoleon's brothers, Joseph and Louis, both of whom were given kingdoms in 1806 by their brother - Joseph became King of Naples and Louis became King of Holland. Next to them are their sisters Caroline Murat, Pauline Borghese and Elisa Bacchiochi, with Louis's wife Hortense holding the hand of little Prince Charles, and Julie, wife of Joseph.",
    "images/LA HYRE, Laurent de/Theseus and Aethra.jpg": "This is a representation of Plutarch's story in which, in the presence of his mother, the young Greek hero Theseus finds the swords and sandals his father Aegeus has buried under a heavy stone.",
    "images/HAMILTON, John/A Lion and a Tiger.jpg": "This canvas is one from a pair, entitled A Lion and a Tiger, and A Tigress with her Cubs Threatened by a Crocodile.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Annunciation (detail) (4).jpg": "Among the symbolic elements in the picture, there is the beautifully rendered transparent glass vase, half full of water, which nourishes the flowers nestled in its neck.",
    "images/SOLARIO, Andrea/Salome with the Head of St John the Baptist (1).jpg": "You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Pesaro Altarpiece (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the background landscape of the central panel of the Pesaro Altarpiece representing the Coronation of the Virgin.",
    "images/CECCO DEL CARAVAGGIO/The Flute Player.jpg": "In a room containing shelves and a table, a young man is about to start playing the flute. Placed on the shelves are bowls, plates and jugs as well as bread and cheese. A small cheese (or head of garlic) hangs precariously from a string tied around a nail on the front of the shelf. On a table, diagonally receding to both left and right, is a glass vase full of water. Other containers on the table are surrounded by single pieces of fruit, a teething ring and a violin and bow.",
    "images/GUALTIERO PADOVANO/Ceiling in the Loggia (detail).jpg": "This detail of the ceiling of the loggia depicts Flora and Mercury.",
    "images/MARREL, Jacob/Still-Life (1).jpg": "This panel depicts a still-life of flowers in a glass vase within a niche, with cherries, shells and a lizard.",
    "images/MARIOTTO DI NARDO/Annunciation.jpg": "The story of the archangel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she, though a virgin, was to give birth to the Messiah depicts in a few verses the reality and the functions of angels.",
    "images/TORELLI, Stefano/Diana and Endymion.jpg": "The beautiful youth, Endymion, who fell into an eternal sleep, has captured the imagination of poets and artists as a symbol of the timelessness of beauty that is 'a joy forever'.",
    "images/MANFREDINO DA PISTOIA/Christ in Glory among Angels.jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the fresco representing Christ Pantocrator between Sts Bartholomew and John the Baptist.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Uzziah - Jotham - Ahaz (detail) (1).jpg": "The right part of the lunette is dominated by the tonality of the heavy reddish-orange mantle with deep yellow shadows that the woman presses to her breast. Although her gaze is not directed at them, she seems to be protective toward the two children by her. The veiled head and the gravity of the attitude and expression of the female figure, together with the pattern of the drapery, reveal that she was probably based on a classical model. His pose resembles to that of ancient funerary statues of torch-bearing genii, and appears to be derived (with variations) from one of the figures of nude youths in the background of the Doni Tondo. With regard to the other boy seen in profile in the background, it has been rightly observed that he appears to have been drawn by the artist with the brush rather than painted.",
    "images/ROSSO FIORENTINO/Deposition from the Cross (detail).jpg": "Transferring to the Virgin, the iconography which from the 14th century in Italy was traditionally used to represent Mary Magdalene, Ross portrays the mother of Christ with her arms splayed and held up, as if she herself was reliving the moment of crucifixion; the expression of the crucified Jesus seems in fact to be impressed upon the face of Mary, who is now prostrate with grief. Behind her, the horrible animal-like figure directing his squint-eyed gaze away from the scene probably takes up the theme of the bodyguard, the symbol of the treachery and wickedness that determined the killing of Christ.",
    "images/MAELLA, Mariano Salvador de/Seascape.jpg": "The picture shows a sketch for tapestry cartoon.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Lady Writing a Letter with Her Maid (detail).jpg": "While the mistress sits at a table, writing and facing the viewer, the maid looks bored through the half open window at some happening outside. Even the curtain to the left and the drapes of the window are treated in a most rigid fashion, sculptural rather than painterly. A large painting, representing the finding of Moses, animates the back wall.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Portrait of the Physician Gian Giacomo Bartolotti da Parma.jpg": "Titian shows the half-length figure of the greying, slightly tousled man in his prime against a dark background. Over his crimson velvet jacket which allows his shirt to show, he wears a broad-sleeved black robe. His left hand adorned with two rings grasps a grey stole cast over his left shoulder.",
    "images/KEYSER, Thomas de/Equestrian Portrait of Pieter Schout.jpg": "The first is Pieter Schout on Horseback, dated 1660, which depicts his patrician patron, who was High Bailiff of Hagstein, on a black Andalusian executing a 'pesade' in a dune landscape; the support of the finely executed piece is copper.",
    "images/MADARÁSZ, Viktor/László Hunyadi on the Bier.jpg": "King László V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. At the feet of body, his mother, Erzsébet Szilágyi, and his bride, Mária Gara, kneel in grief.",
    "images/BRAMANTE, Donato/Man-at-Arms.jpg": "According to Lamazzo, the cycle portrays the most famous men-at-arms of the time; Pietro Suola the Elder, Giorgio Moro da Ficino and Beltrame. The emphasis placed on features such as the tufts of the beard and the tiny wrinkles of the face lend an almost caricatural tone to this parade figure.",
    "images/PIETRO DI GIOVANNI D'AMBROGIO/Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "The bright button-eyed child so cosily wrapped in his swaddling-cylinder looks out under the kindly gaze of the beasts, the ox's horn companionably placed behind the ass's ear. The nocturnal panorama extending beyond the creche, leading across chessboard fields to a dark lake and dominated by the great owl perched on the roof, is among the most astounding landscapes in all Italian painting.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Christ and the Samaritan Woman (scene 6).jpg": "Christ is seated on the edge of a magnificent well made of green marble. The slender, statuesque figure of the Samaritan woman is apparent through the rippling surface of her garment. Once again urban architecture, accurate and regular in its structural lay-out, lends colour to the scene. In Christ and the Samaritan Woman the geometrical compactness of the city of Sichar and the well on which Christ is sitting are in contrast with the slight figure of the woman.",
    "images/MONET, Claude/The Houses of Parliament, London.jpg": "The main subject of the series is light and atmospheric variations.",
    "images/MIERIS, Frans van, the Elder/Duet.jpg": "The curtain drawn aside lets the viewer spy on the elegant, mildly titillating musical partnership.",

    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Peasant Woman by the Fireplace.jpg": "Sewing, spooling thread, peeling potatoes, shelling beans and preparing food were among the most frequently depicted subjects. In the present painting the woman sitting to the right of the fire is peeling a potato. A kettle is boiling over the fire, hanging from a chain barely visible in the curling smoke.",

    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/Madonna and Child with Angels and Saints.jpg": "The represented saints are John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene, Augustine and Martha.",
    "images/ELSHEIMER, Adam/Glorification of the Cross.jpg": "The cross as the focal point of the \"gloria del paradiso\" is revered by the saints and the elect of the heavenly realm who surround the cross on banks of clouds. On the right, we recognize the patriarchs, including Moses, Abraham and King David. We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin.",
    "images/VILLANDRANDO, Rodrigo de/Portrait of a Gentleman.jpg": "This painting represents a gentleman, three-quarter length, wearing a black doublet and hose, with a grey tunic and white ruff, holding his sword and gloves, standing beside a table.",
    "images/RIPPL-RÓNAI, József/Father and Uncle Piacsek Drinking Red Wine.jpg": "There is a constant figure of interior pictures: a old man smoking the pipe while he is meditating. He is present in this picture, too, he is sitting by the artist's father lost in thoughts. Spots and patches painted with wide brushstrokes can be seen in the figure of Uncle Piacsek and the lively yellow of the plain background. This is why an armchair  with blue striped cover  and a green cover are placed  on both sides by the yellow background. The wine-jug and the two glasses have the same function in composition.",
    "images/BERCHEM, Nicolaes/Jupiter Notices Callisto.jpg": "The beautiful nymph Callisto, exhausted from the hunt, has lain down to rest in a glade. Her robust figure fills the entire foreground. Her right hand rests on a deer and a hare she has brought back from the hunt. She is elegant and coquettish, and she attracts the attention of the lecherous Jupiter, supreme ruler of the gods, who passes by on a cloud in the background.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Figures behind the Parapet.jpg": "In the Sala dell'Olimpo, Veronese configured the lower part of the vault as a loggia, and standing the balustrade of this loggia are various figures dressed in contemporary clothing. The prevailing interpretation of the woman in patrician garb is that she is Giustinia Giustiniani, the wife of Marcantonio Barbaro; the simply dressed older woman next to her is then the wet nurse of Giustinina's children.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Asa - Jehoshaphat - Joram (detail).jpg": "On the left, an emaciated old man, traditionally considered to be Jehoshaphat, is seen in full profile. He is sitting in an unusual pose - one leg is extended and the other bent, with the foot resting on the seat - and is engrossed in writing with a reed pen on a parchment placed on his raised knee. He is wearing a loose yellow mantle with bright red shadows that are greenish in the halftones, white trousers tied round the ankles (a style often associated with Orientals in painting) and rose shoes. A gray cap covers his bony head; with its hooked nose and large ears, it is thrust forward on a long neck, from which a prominent Adam's apple protrudes.",
    "images/CSONTVÁRY KOSZTKA, Tivadar/Praying Saviour.jpg": "The angular figure of the Saviour is standing in the middle isolated from everything and everybody. He is raising up his hands  as if praying or preaching. The group of the twelve  apostles are looking out of the picture. Faces are suggestive, those of the Saviour and Moses are expressive. Moses is standing with stone tablets on the left. The silhouette of a town can be seen in the background, it is Jerusalem. On the right, there is a slim tree with a block of stone at its foot with two black figures tumbling on it. Behind the tree, there is a modern church which is lit: it can be approached on a steep slope. Next to it, there are three columns with winged sculptures and a domed building on the left. A group of people are approaching the church. He portrayed the Old Testament on the left and the New Testament on the right: the former  being represented by Moses and the tables of the Testament, and the New Testament by Jesus' sermon, payer, and desciples, the tree symbolizing the cross, and the mourners with a stone suggesting a grave. There are symbolic objects and scenes on both sides. The  background stretches out to the distance.",

    "images/SPADINO, Bartolomeo/Still-Life.jpg": "This canvas depicts a still-life with melon, apples, figs and grapes.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Visitation (1).jpg": "Entirely original, on the other hand are the intertwining arcs of arms and fabric that firmly unites the two protagonists whose distinctly enlarged bodies dominate the painted surface. The monumental scene is depicted in a frozen fashion against the background of a roughly painted, funereally gloomy town. The profile portrayal of the two main figures embracing each other with extreme delicacy and exchanging looks of intense mutual affection is set against the rigidly frontal positions of the two bystanders in the background. Immobile, almost petrified, the latter keep their eyes fixed on something outside the scene, revealing their total lack of emotional participation in the event.",
    "images/MASOLINO da Panicale/Vaulting (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows one of the wider compartments of the vaulting containing the Nativity scene. At the left, below the figure of Joseph, the inscription ribbon displays Masolino's signature.",

    "images/MASOLINO da Panicale/Vaulting of the Chapel (1).jpg": "The picture shows the vaulting in its state before 1987. In the spandrels of the vaulting are the four evangelists with the four Latin Church fathers. The vaulting paintings follow the pattern that had been traditional since the fourteenth century, only here each of the evangelists is paired with one of the Church fathers. They are seated together in pairs on a bank of clouds, and bathed in a yellow light. Each of the evangelists is identified by his symbol.",
    "images/GRECO, El/The Trinity.jpg": "The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos.",
    "images/ROBERT, Hubert/Architectural Capriccio.jpg": "This architectural capriccio shows troubadours and washerwomen by a basin among Roman ruins, a pyramid beyond. At the centre, Robert recreates the commanding bronze equestrian statue of Cosimo I de' Medici, which had been unveiled in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence in 1594.",

    "images/SOREAU, Isaak/Still-Life.jpg": "This is a still-life with a basket of grapes, cherries and a strawberry plant branch on a ledge. The centre has an assortment of grape clusters with their vines delicately placed in a wicker basket, and arranged with some fruits scattered over a wood table top with the edge in the foreground creating depth. The ensemble detaches overall from a dark, neutral background.",

    "images/RIPPL-RÓNAI, József/Girl with Cage.jpg": "The slim silhouette  of a standing woman is in an interior painted in different shades of green. She leans slightly  backwards with the cage in the hand, the unbalanced movement responds to vague colours blurred. In the artificial light suggesting a room, objects can be sensed in vague contours, but the profile and the hands of the woman holding the cage are surprisingly white against the dark background. Colours and patches are blurred and recall  abstract  compositions of art nouveau.",
    "images/REYMERSWAELE, Marinus van/St Jerome.jpg": "The bookstand holds a tome open to a page showing the Last Judgment, which alludes to Jerome's meditations on the end of earthly existence.",

    "images/CLAESZ., Pieter/Still-Life (3).jpg": "This panel depicts a still-life with a silver beaker and an overturned Roemer, with bread, a knife and a lemon and olives on two pewter plates. It shows the artist's pared down approach to still life, in which he abandons the more luxurious displays of his early years in favour of compositions with fewer objects in simpler arrangements.",

    "images/KOCH, Joseph Anton/Heroic Landscape with Rainbow.jpg": "This Heroic Landscape affords a wide view into an idealizes cosmic landscape. It is timeless and placeless, as if a curtain had been raised in a theater on a vision of archaic history. We are shown and ideal that is remote from reality, with shepherds, whose works appears to be effortless. By abandoning aerial perspective, Koch is able to give a clear view into the distance, and both the peaceful rural scene in the foreground and the town with its temple in the middle ground are overarched by the rainbow, the symbol of eternal peace after the deluge.",

    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Portrait of Hieronymus Holzschuher.jpg": "AETATIS SVE 57; to the right, near the head, monogrammed. The artist has filled almost the whole of the upper half of the panel with his subject's powerful head, for which the upper part of the body, clad in heavy fur, seems merely to serve as a plinth, attention being focused on the features. The fine brush has rendered the thick, wavy hair, which has receded somewhat over the forehead, with all the delicacy of a pen-and-ink drawing. At the same time, the face and the full lips are strongly modelled and determine the full-blooded vitality of the man. Reflected in the sitter's eyes are the window-bars of the room in which Dürer worked.",

    "images/GAUGUIN, Paul/Nirvana, Portrait of Meyer de Haan.jpg": "Things sacred are present in the background of Gauguin's portraits, which he wanted to put in expressive harmony with the faces, according to the Symbolist doctrine which inspired also Van Gogh.

    "images/MULTSCHER, Hans/Resurrection.jpg": "The Risen Christ, draped only in a bright red cloth, sits on a massive stone sarcophagus, the red seals on the lid of which are unbroken. The body of Christ bears the stigmata of the Crucifixion. His right hand is raised in the gesture of benediction, while in the left He holds a staff surmounted by a cross. In the confined space between the sarcophagus and the enclosing fence four armed soldiers lie in a deep sleep. When the wings were closed, the altar showed four scenes relating to the Madonna; these (from top left to bottom right) were The Nativity, The Adoration of the Magi, The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin. When opened, the inner sides of the wings showed four scenes from the Passion, which flanked the central Crucifixion.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Last Supper.jpg": "The disciples are sitting at a long table in front of a rear wall that runs parallel to the picture plan. Christ is sitting in the centre, and His favourite disciple John is leaning sadly against Him. To the right of Christ, in the place of honour, is the chief Apostle, Peter. Judas the traitor is the only one to be separated from the others: he is seated in front of the table. The Apostles and Christ are sitting together in a room with a flat ceiling that appears to be too low. Judas is sitting opposite Christ on a three-legged stool in front of the laid table. The figures are set back some distance from us, to a depth of three large floor tiles. The various emotions of the Apostles are indicated by stiff hand movements that scarcely seem alive and express little of the character of the individuals.",
    "images/SCHÖNFELD, Johann Heinrich/Allegory of Time (Chronos and Eros).jpg": "The clear and subtle colours, the vibrant and nervous brushstrokes, and the strong, direct light render his figures evanescent and almost unstable.",
    "images/FERRARI, Gaudenzio/The Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "In this chapel, the themes of the painted stories are devoted entirely to the life of Mary: the Assumption is above the altar and four additional scenes are on the side wall. The composition of the Assumption precisely distinguishes two halves with the apostles below and Mary floating in the sky amid the ring of angels.",

    "images/MOLYN, Pieter de/Dunes.jpg": "Scattered details seen from a low point of view have been subordinated to large areas of light and shadow, and the scene has been unified by prominent diagonals which lead the eye over the dunes past the small figures into the distance.",
    "images/WYNANTS, Jan/Wooded Evening Landscape.jpg": "This large-scale landscape depicts a wooded evening landscape with a hunter and his dogs, another hunter on horseback conversing with a peasant, a fishermen and a falconer carrying a hoop of falcons on a path, a wagon and other figures by a lake beyond. This painting employs one of the artist's favourite compositional structures, with the left side of the canvas built up with dunes and trees, and a winding path leading into an open panoramic view at right.",
    "images/NAIVEU, Matthijs/Portrait of a Gentleman.jpg": "The painting shows the portrait of a gentleman, three quarter length seated, wearing a brown coat with a red cape and a white scarf.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Legend of St Francis 18. Apparition at Arles.jpg": "Giotto depicts the saint with outspread arms - the resulting shape of the cross alludes to his Christ-like life. Only St. Anthony, who had just been speaking about Christ, and one other member of the Order notice the apparition. Giotto shows all the others listening with full attention. The figures seen from the back are also particularly impressive, the artist making the weight of the bodies plain for all to see.",
    "images/FERENCZY, Károly/Joseph Sold into Slavery by his Brothers.jpg": "The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO/View of the former loggia.jpg": "The photo shows the former loggia of the Villa Carducci as it appears today.",

    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/9. Exaltation of the Cross.jpg": "An angel then told him that he would have to walk barefoot, carrying the cross in humility, as Christ did. Heraclius, barefoot, has carried the cross up to the walls of Jerusalem. There he and his train are met by a group of men who kneel down before the cross in veneration. The Oriental noblemen wear splendid Greek headdresses, the exotic elegance of them had been admired by all Florentines at the time. In the midday light and under the blue sky, they vary from pale blue to violet, from bottle-green to pearl-white. He conveys the impression of a race of mature men, rationally at peace with themselves.",
    "images/TREVISANI, Francesco/The Madonna Sewing with the Christ Child.jpg": "As with many of the paintings Trevisani executed for him, Ottoboni's emblem, the double-headed eagle, is included; in this case on the vase of flowers centre left.",

    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/Commodore Augustus Keppel.jpg": "The borrowed pose bears the thought of the idealization of the individual. Keppel is standing on a small strip of shoreline in front of a steep cliff-face. The scenery with the storm, the wild surf, the rocky coast and the flickering lightning is in accordance with the aesthetic of the sublime, and enhances the heroic character of the naval officer, who, unimpressed by the forces of nature, poses for the painter. The pose and the landscape idealize the sitter.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Lunette fresco (detail) (6).jpg": "The picture shows the personification of Summer.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Ceiling with four medallions.jpg": "Four tondi present views into heaven, of God the Father, Christ and his tempter, the Trinity and apostles, and finally Christ between Justice and Grace. The scenes depicted clearly relate to the new pope.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Jesse - David - Solomon (detail).jpg": "David is wearing clothes in Oriental style: a green cap-cum-hood hanging down over his shoulders, resembles the Arab kaffiyeh; the upper part of his robe is rose, the lower part yellow. His arms are folded across his chest and, with his left hand, he holds the edge of a white cloth, possibly also having a ritual function, spread over his knees. His hand, modeled with remarkable energy, and the folds of the lower part of the robe, emerge forcefully in the foreground. David's face, partly in shadow under his headdress, expresses great concentration, though he seems to have suddenly noticed something on his left.",
    "images/MONTAGNA, Bartolomeo/Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints.jpg": "The represented figures are Sts Andrew, Monica, Ursula, Sigismund and angel musicians. The large capitals in the background frieze are the initials of the Latin phrase meaning: \"Implore God's grace for us.\" The medallion on the left portrays Matteo de' Pasti's profile plaque of Christ. In this altarpiece, the noble figures are displayed within a purely Lombard architectural setting.",
    "images/BANDINELLI, Baccio/Self-Portrait.jpg": "This self-portrait shows the artist seated in an impressive classical architectural setting and pointing to a drawing of two male nudes, perhaps representing Hercules and Cacus, the subject of one of Bandinelli's most famous sculptures.",
    "images/BASSANO, Jacopo/Adoration of the Kings.jpg": "The painting presents a magnificent pageant as the three kings present to the newborn Child their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The painter's skill in portraying animals, unsurpassed among his contemporaries, is evident in the beautifully observed details of the ox and the ass, on the far left, and the dogs. The picturesque ruins on the left, for example, are certainly intended to be symbolic of the decay of pagan antiquity with the coming of Christ. The central figure in the painting, the king in the striped doublet may be identified as a portrait of the painting's patron, Jacopo Gisi. The two page-boys behind him may also be portraits of his sons.",
    "images/STROZZI, Bernardo/Lute Player.jpg": "The lute is a plucked string instrument with a fretted neck and a deep round back.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Last Judgment Triptych (central panel) (1).jpg": "This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as Dürer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: \"Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes\". The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background. In any event, earth has become indistinguishable from Hell, depicted on the right wing, out of which the army of Satan swarms to attack the damned; the eternity of torment has begun.",
    "images/GIOVANNI AGOSTINO DA LODI/Washing of the Feet.jpg": "Christ appears to be irritated by their failure to understand. The only relaxed figure is the nameless, curly-locked donor, who is already preparing the towel to dry Peter's feet.",
    "images/WITTE, Emanuel de/Interior of the Oude Kerk, Delft.jpg": "The space covered by wood vaulting is the Mariakoor (Mary's Choir).

    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Corn Harvest (August).jpg": "Once again, Bruegel's composition is made up of a harmonious combination of figures and landscape, showing human preoccupations set against a background of nature and religious faith (represented by the church on the right). This panel depicts fieldworkers who are exhausted, lying or sitting, eating or sleeping.",
    "images/FAGAN, Robert/Anna Maria Ferri, the Artist's First Wife.jpg": "The present portrait, depicting Maria in a striking yellow dress with a blue fur-lined cloak and bonnet, may have been painted around the time of their marriage.",
    "images/URBANI, Andrea/The Swan Attacked by Dogs.jpg": "The north wall depicts Sleeping Eros with a Putto and Doves in a Starry Landscape; the east wall, a Landscape with a Stone Bridge and Isolated Cottage by the Light of Dawn; the south wall, a broad daylight scene with The Swan Attacked by Dogs; and the west wall, a Landscape with a Small Village and Fleeing Wolves at Sunset.",
    "images/NEER, Eglon van der/Elegant Couple in an Interior.jpg": "The rich, fashionably dressed burghers who are the subject of Elegant Couple in an Interior are shown surrounded by several servants. Van der Neer paid great attention to the costly fabrics of the clothes of the elegant couple in the foreground. The fact that the couple in the background are drinking and their rather too intimate behaviour might indicate that this is a brothel scene.",
    "images/BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz/Portrait of Geertruida Hasselaer.jpg": "The sitter is depicted standing three quarter length before a curtain, wearing a yellow silk dress and lace chemise, pearls and bonnet, with her right hand holding the train of her dress against her breast.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/9. Exaltation of the Cross (detail) (5).jpg": "The group of Jerusalem notables, young and old, kneel as they worshipfully receive the Holy Wood. The faces, with perfectly conserved flesh tones, have various expressions showing the ecstasy of their adoration.",
    "images/SCOREL, Jan van/Madonna of the Daffodils with the Christ Child and Donors.jpg": "This panel depicts a plain interior adorned only with a green curtain, which creates the background, leaving one section of the wall visible. Before it, and occupying the centre of the composition, is the Virgin holding some narcissi, and the Christ Child. Flanking them is the pair of unidentified donors.",

    "images/MATTEO di Giovanni/Calling of Sts Peter and Andrew.jpg": "This painting shows Jesus on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, urging two fishermen, the brothers Peter and Andrew, to become his disciples. Jesus leans forward to help Peter out of the boat, while Andrew casts his net aside, symbolically leaving his old life behind.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/Maestà (Virgin with Child Enthroned between Saints and Angels).jpg": "Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures.",
    "images/CONTE, Jacopino del/Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Gaddi.jpg": "This portrait depicts an architectural background in the left, with light falling through a window. The cardinal holds gloves in one hand.",
    "images/FÉNYES, Adolf/Shelling Beans.jpg": "He enhanced the subject matter, an everyday one of three figures husking beans in a village yard, to an ecstatic spectacle. In the delicately tinted picture, reflexes of colours, greyish, bluish and pinky shades are clearly visible which divide the canvass into patches of colours. Due to the sunshine which can substract colours and make even shadows colourful, the picture is rich in colours: shades of red, ultramarine and blues are mixed with grey.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Younger/Nymph of the Spring (detail).jpg": "The meticulously detailed landscape background is populated by tiny humans and animals. To the right of the mill, one person walks along the riverbank while another kneels by the water. A driver drives three donkeys, loaded with sacks of grain, toward the mill. Further back, beyond the walled city, two deer graze in a grassy clearing, and persons on foot and on horseback follow trails into the forest. A castle set high upon a bluff presides over the landscape.",

The burning candle, pocket watch and hourglass denote the passage of time and brevity of life; the violin with a broken string indicates the transient pleasure of music; the money bag denotes the worldly riches, the scholarly books and globes the vanity of learning, and the military flag the worldly power. On a piece of paper at far right one can read: Vanitas/Vanitatu(m)/Et Omnia/Vanitas",
    "images/ROBERTI, Ercole de'/St John the Baptist.jpg": "The emaciated and mystical figure of St John the Baptist rises above the rocks; the ledge on which John stands seems to melt away as we watch.

    "images/LAJOUE, Jacques de/Garden View with Fountains.jpg": "This composition features a fountain bordered by Corinthian columns, and a tall winding tree expanding from the fountain at right.",
    "images/CASSATT, Mary/Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge.jpg": "Without defining any middle distance, Cassatt places the figure squarely up front, while the mirror in which we see her back reflected (which at first glance seems a background of gallery seats) actually shows us what Lydia herself sees before her.",
    "images/HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van/Portrait of a Man.jpg": "This painting portrays an unidentified man, half-length, standing before a green curtain.",
    "images/WERENSKIOLD, Erik/Autumn.jpg": "The throng of passers-by we might expect in a city scene is replaced here by two horses at work. The muted and somewhat melancholy colours show the influence of Gauguin's Impressionist phase.",
    "images/MAFFEI, Francesco/Sight.jpg": "This painting is an allegory of sight, as may be deduced from the presence of a mirror and an eagle.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/Burial of St Martin (scene 10).jpg": "The frescoes of the Death and Funeral on the upper level are the last scenes of the cycle. Animated by light, colour and spatial depth, both these scenes have the same composition, with a crowd of acolytes and followers witnessing the events. The same characters, with the same features but depicted in different poses and with different gestures appear in both scenes: the priest celebrating the ritual of the deceased in the scene of Martin's Death appears in the fresco of the Funeral between the two figures with haloes; the tonsured acolyte dressed in green and red who in the Death is gazing meditatively upwards, in the Funeral is shown holding the celebrant's dalmatic.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/The Flagellation (detail) (1).jpg": "The figures at the right are probably portraits and there are many attempts by scholars to identify them. The youthful, barefoot figure in the group, clothed only in a plain red garment is traditionally identified as Duke Oddantonio, Federico de Montefeltro's half-brother who was murdered in his nightshirt.",
    "images/MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban/Birth of the Virgin.jpg": "Under the glow of soft light, the figures dissolve into the ambient space, intensifying the tender sentiment of the narrative. St Anne lies in a canopied bed, attended by Joachim, while the newborn infant is removed from the bath by a rotund, matronly woman. The baby is handed for drying to a helper, with assistance from two putti, who remove toweling from a wicker basket. A young woman carrying the clothing emerges from the shadow, and two angels sweetly genuflect before the radiant child.",

The picture shows the Death of Actaeon.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/The Rape of the Sabine Women (detail).jpg": "The turbulent scene plays out in front of the viewer as if on a stage: from his elevated position on the left, Romulus gives the pre-arranged signal to his companions to seize and carry off the virgins amongst the Sabines, who had been invited to attend a festival organized by the Romans. On the square below, his signal sparks a rotary motion amongst the figures, who are rushing away from the centre in all directions.",

The moment shown is that when Agostina Zaragoza, the wife of the gunner dying in the lower left corner, seizes the lighted match and fires the gun at the encroaching forces.

The girls are bringing food to the hermit and, in return, he is giving them rosaries and votary medals, which he takes from a box held by a handsome young friar. The girls are dressed in ordinary gowns, apart from the two closest to the hermit who are all in white; they are receiving rosaries from him in preparation for their confirmation. The theme is one of charity, generosity and virtue: the young women are taking physical care of the hermit and he, in return, is giving them spiritual rewards.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Catalan/Christ and the Twelve Apostles.jpg": "Round the central figure are narrative scenes or a hieratic arrangement of the apostles. Every single figure is schematic: the apostles stand stiffly upright, each one holding some object by which he can be identified - and yet the artist has breathed life into these figures. Christ, judging the world, places his hand on a book with the very gesture that might be used by a student of the law as he closes the codex in which he has sought guidance in reaching a fair jjudgment.",

    "images/BOUYS, André/La Récureuse.jpg": "The subject is humble enough, domestic and also notably demure in treatment.

It is thought that the churchman dressed in black in front of him is the man who commissioned the panel painting, Francesco di Giovanni Tesori. Above these two portraits, the Slaughter of the Innocents in Bethlehem is shown. The town beyond this, in which we can see monuments such as  the Colosseum, Trajan's Column, the Torre del Milizie, and a pyramid, is meant to be reminiscent of Rome.",

A scroll of paper in the bureau bears the word 'Code\", which refers to the new Civil Code, actually in operation since 1804 but which was renamed the 'Code Napoleon' in 1807 in an obvious propaganda move to promote him as a legislator. In the portrait the emperor has evidently just stopped work and, as the sword on the chair indicates, now prepares to review the troops wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Foot Grenadier Guards.",
    "images/LUCA DI TOMMÈ/Crucifixion.jpg": "It depicts the Crucifixion with the two thieves, the Madonna, Saint John and Mary Magdalene, and a pelican piercing its breast above. The miniature like detail of the pelican's nest above the cross is an interesting motif: according to legend, the pelican pierced her own breast with her beak to feed her chicks with blood from her own heart.",
    "images/ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe/Water (1).jpg": "This version of Water of exquisite quality remains quite faithful in most details to the original in Vienna; the most noticeable difference is that the pearl necklace is missing, and the squid is missing from the chin area.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Interior of the Sistine Chapel (2).jpg": "The picture shows a view of the interior of the chapel toward the entrance wall. The upper order is endowed with pilasters that support the pendentives of the vault. Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Coast Scene with the Rape of Europa.jpg": "Jupiter, enamoured with Europa, the daughter of Agenor, changes himself into a white bull and mingles with the herd of cattle on the seashore where Europa and her maidens linger. Attracted by the beauty of the bull and not aware of Jupiter's transformation, Europa climbs onto its back and is abducted, eventually being carried out to sea. The mood of the picture is established principally by the chief compositional features of trees, coastline, vessels and fortification judiciously placed within the picture space. The care lavished on the draperies, the flowers and garlands, the waves lapping the sides of the vessels, and the down along the flanks of the cattle testify to the precision of Claude's art in creating a world that oscillates between quotidian experience and arcadian bliss.",

It is situated in the upper row on the right side above the scene of the Deposition. The same characters appear in the Entombment as in the Crucifixion (of the three women, the one with the blue garment is missing), all leaning over Christ's body. Joseph arranges the shroud, John gently lifts Christ's head, Mary kisses him for the last time. Only Mary Magdalene expresses her despair emotionally, lifting both her arms to heaven.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Apollo and the Continents (Africa, right-hand side).jpg": "The personification of Africa sits astride a dromedary in the hustle and bustle of a market scene, surrounded by Negroes, Orientals and Europeans. She is being offered an incense burner, which, along with other vessels on magnificent cloths and the tusks of ivory, symbolize the goods and the riches of the continent, so coveted by the Europeans. Africa is clearly depicted as a much more civilized place than America.",

    "images/GRECO, El/Baptism of Christ.jpg": "The portable altarpiece, whose unknown patron perhaps stemmed from a Creto-Venetian family, in its open state shows a total of six scenes: on the front, the central panel bears a rare depiction of the Coronation of the Christian Knight, and on the wings we find the Adoration of the Shepherds on the left and the Baptism of Christ on the right. On the reverse, a View of Mount Sinai with its famous convent of St Catherine is flanked by an Annunciation  and an Admonition of Adam and Eve by God the Father.",
    "images/BOCANEGRA, Pedro Anastasio/St Dominic in Soriano.jpg": "This subject occurs in Dominican church art of the baroque period and shows the monk dressed in the habit of his Order kneeling before the Virgin and two saints, receiving the portrait. It is a full-length picture of Dominic and shows him holding a lily and a book.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple.jpg": "In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici. In the group at the right Ghirlandaio depicts famous contemporary artists (including himself) who can be identified from the description of Vasari as Alesso Baldovinetti, Bastiano Mainardi, Davide and Domenico Ghirlandaio.",
    "images/TILBORGH, Gillis van/Guardroom Scene.jpg": "This painting represents the interior of a guardroom. It depicts an officer reading a letter for four men, amidst a pile of weapons and a war standard.",

    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Portrait of the Merchant Georg Gisze (detail).jpg": "Besides utilitarian articles such as the seal, the office of merchant Georg Gisze is notable for such sumptuous items as an Anatolian carpet that covers the table, a yellow case clock, and a slender crystal vase made of Venetian glass, through which the gleaming pink silk of Gisze's sleeve is visible. The plants in the bouquet may allude to various things: carnations and rosemary, for example, traditionally symbolize love and fidelity respectively.",
    "images/VERNET, Horace/Returning from the Market.jpg": "The figure wears traditional Russian furs and boots, making his way across a snowy landscape.",
    "images/HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van/Triumphal Procession of Bacchus.jpg": "The figures are packed into the foreground as they progress through a ruined triumphal arch towards the temple of Bacchus. Bacchus, the god of wine, can scarcely sit up. The satyr supporting him playfully tweaks his breast and, with tongue wagging, stares lustily at the viewer. Two children hold up a mirror so the viewer can see an inebriated man who, having lost all decorum, defecates. Some celebrants stand or stride, other do somersaults and walk on stilts. The horn player in the foreground conveys the artist's knowledge of anatomy and contrapposto. The standing man on the right was inspired by the Apollo in the de Sassi's collection.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Portrait of Johannes Kleberger.jpg": "Dürer takes up again the age-old theme of the comparison of the figurative arts, or, more specifically, the discussion of the predominance of one on the other. Yet the portrait Dürer delivers shows a very hard-looking man: a hardness underscored from the classical type of pose and from the indication of the coldness of the stone. Behind the inscription (E[FFIGIES] IOAN[N]I KLEBERGERS NORICI AN[N]O AETA[TIS] SVAE XXXX) lies the cabalistic sign of the sol in corde leonis, which is the conjunction of the brightest star of Leo, with the sun that was taken from the De occulta philosophia of Agrippa von Nettesheim (1510). The symbol also represents an amulet against melancholy. In the lower corners, to the left and right, are the redende Wappen (figurative coats of arms) of the Kleberger family.",
    "images/WITHOOS, Matthias/Architectural Capriccio.jpg": "This architectural capriccio shows the Forum in Rome, with the Arch of Constantine and the Coliseum in the background. It combines elements of Roman architecture with highly naturalistic depictions of trees and flowers. The foreground section of the canvas, dominated by flowers, could constitute a painting in itself as it appears to stand apart from the rest of the composition.",
    "images/MASTER of Flémalle/The Holy Trinity.jpg": "The side panels represent St Veronica who holds the cloth marked with the face of Christ,and the standing figure of Virgin Mary who suckles the infant Christ. The third panel, probably from the reverse side of the retable, represents the Holy Trinity in grisaille: God the Father supports the dead Christ and shows the body to the whole community; the Holy Spirit is present in the form of a dove.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II.jpg": "Her towering figure, in opulent dress, is set against a jewel-toned backdrop of nearly abstract patterned blocks that suggest a richly decorated domestic interior.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Land of Cockaigne.jpg": "A peasant, a knight and a scholar are lying with full bellies under a tree around the trunk of which a tabletop has been fixed. The squire, wearing some pieces of the knight's armour, is keeping watch, hoping that something will fly into his mouth. Behind the fairy-tale fantasy of the land in which there is nourishment in abundance lies the experience of ever-recurring famine.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Death of the Virgin.jpg": "In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). This picture shows the scene of Death of the Virgin.",
    "images/ROTARI, Pietro Antonio/Queen Maria Josepha, Wife of King Augustus III of Poland.jpg": "This portrait shows the Queen at the age of 56. Among her exquisite items of jewellery she wears a drop-shaped brilliant in her hair that is held in place by a clip shaped like a black eagle. The miniature portrait on her richly adorned bracelet shows her husband. The painting conforms to the concept of the eloquent portrait; the sitter directs her gaze at the viewer, and her hand points to the portrait of her husband, the picture's pendant.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/View of the ballrom toward the east wall.jpg": "The decoration of the ballroom covers the entire wall surface.",
    "images/COZZARELLI, Guidoccio/Madonna and Child with Saints.jpg": "In this devotional painting, to the right of the Madonna and Child are Sts Sebastian and Roch, both of whom were invoked for protection against sickness, and on the left is St Julian the Hospitaler. In the lower register, on either side of the Dead Christ are depicted the twin brothers and physicians Sts Cosmas and Damian, wearing their distinctive physician's hats and holding their medical instruments.",

    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/View of the vaults (1).jpg": "The vaulting shows the four Evangelists on concentrically painted clouds. The four Evangelists symbolize the kingdom of God, and they are depicted on the four fields of the groin vault in the process of reading or writing down their works: St Mark is shown with the lion, St Matthew with the angel, St Luke with the ox and St John with the eagle. The concentrically painted clouds create the impression of a circular vault.",
    "images/DAVID, Jacques-Louis/The Intervention of the Sabine Women (detail) (2).jpg": "In place of the sinew and muscle of the men in The Oath of the Horatii, which came from close observation of the life model, Romulus and Tatius have smooth bodies, based on a study of sculpture.",

    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Venus of Urbino (detail).jpg": "In the corner of the room two servant-girls are perhaps looking for some garment - their presence in the picture being an excuse for the artist to create a sense of homeliness by means of what seems to be a workaday scene. Their gestures fairly vibrate in the light pouring in at the window, engendering a near-musical effect in the background, and enhancing the vital inner sparkle of Venus' nude body. The dog, the roses held by Venus, and the myrtle plant on the window ledge are all symbols of the constancy of love.",
    "images/DELEN, Dirck van/Distinguished Dinner Company in an Interior.jpg": "These pictures are conceived like peepshows or perspective boxes: they open onto a view of opulent interior with staffage, in which skilfully applied rules of perspective, most spectacular in the ingeniously constructed coffered ceilings, play a dominant role.",
    "images/BONZI, Pietro Paolo/Still-Life with a Young Boy as Bacchus.jpg": "A number of details indicate the artist's Caravaggesque training in the workshop of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi (1577-1635): the insistence on the description of the large vine leaves, and the young boy (a servant whose left hand holds the other end of the vine branch that rings his head) disguised as Bacchus, as well as the lustrous bronze reflections on the copper container.",

    "images/AVERCAMP, Hendrick/Ice Scene (1).jpg": "The painting depicts a frozen canal with many people amusing themselves. People are skating, sledging and playing a game called 'kolf', a sort of ice hockey. On the left, a group of people have fallen through the ice, but help is already on the way. And just in front of the bridge, a woman has fallen over, revealing her bare bottom.",
    "images/MASTER of the Castello della Manta/Nine Heroes and Nine Heroines (detail with eight figures).jpg": "This frieze-like cycle of eighteen figures fills the north wall, and like the other cycle, it overlaps the two end walls. The cycle begins to the right of the west fireplace with Hector. The Nine Heroes are broken up into three groups of three each, or triads. The pagan triad is composed of Hector, Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar; the Jewish triad of Joshua, David, and Judas Maccabeus; and the Christian one of King Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey de Bouillon. The series of the Nine Heroines begins without any break at the centre of the wall. They are, from left to right: Delphile of Athens; Sinope, queen of Bosnia; Hyppolyte, ruler of the country bordering Bosnia (Macedonia?); Semiramis, the bellicose queen of the Assyrians who conquered the Scythians and Barbarians; the African Aetiope, who conquered India; Lampedo, who subjugated Asia and Europe; Tomyris, who dipped the head of the Persian king Cyrus in blood; Teucha, a ruler of the Illyrians; and finally the queen of the Amazons, Penthesilea, who allied herself with the Trojans and fought against the Greeks after Hector's death, only to be killed, like him, by Achilles. She and Hector, the first in line, were fighters for the same cause, and in this space they come to stand directly across from one another.",

    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Eleonora Gonzaga.jpg": "Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet drape, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window. Titian's landscape is expansive but untraversible, marked by a church tower in its idealized blue distance.",
    "images/VERROCCHIO, Andrea del/Virgin and Child with Two Angels (1).jpg": "Looking at the hands of the two angels we can see that Lorenzo was more concerned with painting flesh, while Verocchio wanted to show the definition of the joints beneath – an interest that related perhaps to his other practice as a sculptor.",
    "images/BLOEMAERT, Abraham/Landscape with Peasants Resting.jpg": "His peasant landscape contains certain Mannerist elements such as the large distance between the foreground objects and the sweeping horizon, or in the way in which he has united contrasts.",
    "images/FONTEBASSO, Francesco/The Banquet of Zenobia (detail) (2).jpg": "The detail shows the small orchestra that entertains the assembly.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Scenes from the Life of St John the Evangelist 3. Ascension of the Evangelist (detail) (1).jpg": "Christ, surrounded by heavenly hosts, appears above the building. He emits golden rays, which envelop the body of the evangelist.",
    "images/MARATTI, Carlo/Apollo Chasing Daphne.jpg": "Maratti depicts the point at which Apollo almost catches up Daphne and she is rescued by changing into an olive tree. In the foreground lies Peneus, recognisable as river god by his crock of flowing water. His Apollo follows the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican. The nymph to Apianus' right strongly resembles a print by Marcantonio Raimondi based on Raphael.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/San Luca Polyptych (detail) (2).jpg": "The picture shows the panel representing St Justina.",
    "images/BORCHT, Hendrik van der, the Elder/Still-Life.jpg": "This still-life consists of ancient coins, glassware and pots on a table-top with an oil lamp.",
    "images/BOUCHER, François/The Toilet of Venus.jpg": "The cupids and the doves are attributes of Venus as goddess of Love. The flowers allude to her role as patroness of gardens and the pearls to her mysterious birth from the sea. The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.",
    "images/DAVID, Jacques-Louis/Portrait of Doctor Alphonse Leroy.jpg": "David shows him as an intelligent and refined man, dressed in fine clothes, writing at his desk leaning on a volume of Hippocrates' Morbi mulierum (The Diseases of Women), lit by a quinquet lamp - a recent invention that gave illumination equal in strength to a dozen candles.",
    "images/SEYBOLD, Christian/Self-Portrait as a Young Man.jpg": "He wears a grey jacket, a white scarf and a softly gathered brown beret. The background is neutral and no curtain, landscape or objects related to the painting profession were included.",
    "images/ROMBOUTS, Salomon/Torrent in a Scandinavian Landscape.jpg": "This painting depicts a river rushing through a rocky northern landscape.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/Hercules Choking Juno's Snakes (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a detail from the ceiling fresco with the Deeds of Hercules and his Apotheosis in the Hercules Hall, Liechtenstein Garden Palace at Rossau.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Rio dei Mendicanti.jpg": "Unlike other pictures from the same set, it shows a part of the city not found on the itinerary of most visitors. At the left the footway runs along before the church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti and the Scuola di San Marco. The artist has particularly exploited the colourful laundry hung out from the rooftops and windows at the right.",
    "images/GUÉRIN, Pierre-Narcisse/Henri de la Rochejaquelin.jpg": "This handsome general astride a barricade, with the white Bourbon flag behind him and the order of the Sacred Heart pinned on his breast, was plucked from the early history of royalist resistance as a deliberate counter to the republican icons of David and Gros.",
    "images/RING, Ludger tom, the Younger/Still-Life.jpg": "It is a still-life with wild roses, peonies and other flowers in a white earthenware vase. Flowers had been depicted in art for centuries as part of larger compositions, but by the early 16th century they began to play a more prominent role, and instead of being shown wild in the fields, began to  appear in interior scenes in vases and other containers.",
    "images/COSTA, Lorenzo the Elder/Venus.jpg": "This depiction of a naked Venus holding a light linen veil can be considered as an allegorical representation of eternal joy.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/St Augustine Altarpiece (right wing).jpg": "The right wing of the altarpiece represents Sts Augustine, Catherine of Alexandria and the kneeling Anthony of Padua.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Jacob's Dream.jpg": "Together they form a swarm of figures, isolated and in groups, arranged in an extraordinary variety of compositions and poses.",
    "images/STARNINA, Gherardo di Jacopo/Thebaid.jpg": "The work depicts the life of a certain saint and the desert life of a large number of hermits, an iconographical theme whose origins are to be found in Pisan art. The painting is occupied entirely by numerous small scenes and by the activities of small figures. The vast landscape is dotted with chapels and tiny dwellings. The foreground is occupied by the sea, with sailing vessels and sea monsters, while the background is composed of the usual stepped rocks, common in all painting of the fourteenth century, which divide the painting up into many compartments.",
    "images/ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael/Allegories of Princely Munificence (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the ceiling fresco.",
    "images/ADEMOLLO, Luigi/Episodes in Roman History (1).jpg": "The picture shows The Emperor's Triumph.",
    "images/COLLIER, Edwart/Portrait of a Gentleman.jpg": "This signed and dated painting shows an unidentified gentleman, three-quarter length, in a black cape, holding a glove, standing in front of a curtain.",
    "images/GENTILESCHI, Artemisia/St Cecilia Playing a Lute.jpg": "Although the figure plays the lute in the painting, the presence of a portable organ behind her confirms the identification of the subject as St Cecilia.",
    "images/ROSSO FIORENTINO/Assumption of the Virgin (detail).jpg": "Individual apostles in Rosso's fresco are attenuated and in motion. The draperies are massive and consist of a few billowing folds, such that the apostles appear to be composed mostly of drapery, which contributes to the expressive potential of the poses. Many heads are highly agitated as they crane upwards to follow the Virgin's ascent.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist (detail) (2).jpg": "The false prophet is shown disseminating his lies and spreading his message of destruction. He has the features of Christ, but it is Satan (portrayed behind him) who tells him what to say. The people around him, who have piled up gifts at the foot of his throne, have clearly already been corrupted by the iniquities the Gospel has warned us of.",
    "images/PITTONI, Giambattista/St Elizabeth Distributing Alms.jpg": "From the loose semi-circle of kneeling, sitting and recumbent paupers the white-robed figure of the princess stands out triumphantly, her outstretched arms bringing the groups of starving men and women into a close circle. The gestures are graceful and dainty, the proportions elongated, the colouring dominated by the pale blues and lemon-yellows favoured by Pittoni.",
    "images/DYCK, Sir Anthony van/Charles I on Horseback.jpg": "This likeness of the king on horseback takes as its point of departure the archetypal image on the obverse of all the Great Seals of England: the sovereign as warrior. King Charles is wearing Greenwich-made armour and holding a commander's baton. A page carries his helmet. Over his armour Charles wears a gold locket bearing the image of Saint George and the Dragon, the so-called Lesser George. As Garter Sovereign he is riding, like Charles V, at the head of his chivalrous knights in defence of the faith. Albeit high above our heads - the horizon line ensures that our viewpoint is roughly at the level of his stirrup - his face is undistorted by foreshortening. Van Dyck's three-quarter view refines his features, and he bestrides his horse with a remote air of noble contemplation.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/Meditation (detail).jpg": "Martin sits on a simple foldstool (the same one that Emperor Julian was sitting on in the scene of Martin renouncing arms), while two acolytes try to bring him back to reality so he can celebrate mass in the chapel nearby: one of them is shaking him gently.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Legend of St Brigid (detail) (4).jpg": "The detail shows St Brigid averting a storm. The fowler in the foreground may be Lorenzo Lotto's self-portrait.",
    "images/HEUSCH, Jacob de/The Campo Vaccino, Rome.jpg": "Here de Heusch depicts the busy daily life of the Roman Forum, known as the 'Campo Vaccino' since the end of the sixteenth century due to the herds of cows that grazed there.",
    "images/WOUWERMAN, Philips/Setting out on the Hunt.jpg": "In this painting the horses have been saddled and the hounds are waiting in front of a grand country house for the chase to begin. The scene is aristocratic in character, as can be seen not only from the noble villa, but also from the sculptures adorning the buildings, the Baroque fountain, and the elegance of the hunting party. Wouwerman introduces a touch of genre painting into the work by placing a mother with two children squatting on the ground and a beggar asking for alms to the left of the picture. The elegant subject matter, the expansive southern landscape, the horses caught most faithfully in their movements, the depictions of figures with loving attention to detail, and the sensitive use of colour are all typical of Wouwerman's late period.",
    "images/VEEN, Otto van/The Triumph of Wisdom over Fortune.jpg": "The Medusa shield he holds is the attribute of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, and the female figure is identifiable as Fortune by her cornucopia, thus bearing out the inscription, lower right: Sapienzia Fortuna uictricx.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/Triumph of Battista Sforza.jpg": "This picture shows the reverse side of the Portrait of Battista Sforza. It represents a Triumph matching that on the reverse of the portrait of her husband, and it is shown in the same scale.",
    "images/BRANDI, Giacinto/Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane.jpg": "The Christ in the Garden is characterized by an atmosphere of great intimacy. The pyramidal grouping of Christ comforted by two angels emerges as it were from a dense bank of clouds, which appear indeed to be invading the scene from the left.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/Crucifixion (detail) (3).jpg": "The men on horseback surround the figures assembled around Christ's cross.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ignudo (16).jpg": "The picture shows the Ignudo at the lower left corner of the Separation of Light from Darkness (above the prophet Jeremiah). Thus, the one above Jeremiah at the left, with a classical profile and a meditative attitude, contrasts sharply with the ungainly movement of the one the right, who laden with foliage and acorns, is throwing himself forward, his face in the shadow. On the opposite side, the two figures bend toward the centre, but with their torsos heads rotating in opposite directions with clearly distinct movements, splendidly rendered thanks to the artist's skilled use of perspective.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Altar of Dionysos.jpg": "The expanded segmental arch was filled by Gustav Klimt with a comparatively condensed composition centring on a temple staircase, which is seen in steep perspective from below. In the middle, there is the archaic head of the bearded god in gilt bronze; beside it, a small, grey figurine of a kouros presumably carved from stone. Flowers and ivy tendrils cascade down on either side of them.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Annunciation.jpg": "The angel in from the left, the hand raised in the gesture of the annunciation. Under the classical portico the Virgin seems almost belittled behind the wooden lectern, in a pose of resigned submission to the will of God. The intimate character of the apparition is underlined by the presence of everyday objects and animals: the quail, the fruit placed on the steps of the lectern, the half-open work basket.",
    "images/SALIMBENI, Lorenzo/View of the Oratory (1).jpg": "The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle and two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Legend of St Brigid (detail) (2).jpg": "The various narrative scenes on the long entrance wall (the south wall), depicted on a large scale in the foreground and a small scale in the landscape beyond, represent episodes from the life of St Brigid, an Irish nun venerated for her charitable activity on behalf of the poor and sick and, most appropriate in the context of the rural community of Trescore, as a protector of crops and farm animals against natural disasters. Thus, in the central section next to and above the doorway, the saint in her distinctive yellow habit is presented four times: in the left foreground she gives food (raw meat, which miraculously has failed to mark her habit) and drink (water miraculously transformed into beer) to two peasant women; to the right, she heals a blind man; in the left background she saves a flock of sheep from a wild boar; and in the right background she halts the advance of a devastating storm.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus.jpg": "Armed warriors are seen in the act of seizing the naked maidens and bearing them away on horseback. The two divergent diagonals rise from the base of the painting, where the feet of captive and aggressor are placed side by side. The volumes ascend from this point, harmoniously residing on successive points of equilibrium, while the luminous white forms of the nude victims contrast with the tanned, caparisoned bodies of their hirsute rapists.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Absinthe Drinkers.jpg": "The last two customers at the café are seated in the right-hand part of the painting, with the gray reflection of the street behind them. The couple is surrounded by emptiness. They become the symbol of a nameless destiny.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra (detail).jpg": "This section shows Cleopatra and Antony in the middle of a group of men of all ages in Oriental dress, the latter presenting a large variation of different types of figure. The main actors are emphasized by their magnificent costumes. Cleopatra's robes bring to mind the bridal dress for a royal wedding, like the one Tiepolo would eventually execute in his Würzburg frescoes.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Rehoboam - Abijah (detail).jpg": "On the left a woman is depicted in profile; she sits alone, gazing out into the chapel, leaning backward with her elbow on the back of the seat. This is a detail that is only found here, and it may be compared to the low step on which, on the other side of the lunette, the sleeping young man rests a foot. The woman's right arm and hand are stretched out on her leg, while her left hand points to the unborn child she is carrying in her womb.",
    "images/BOILLY, Louis Léopold/Portrait of Madame Saint-Ange Chevrier in a Landscape.jpg": "In the present portrait the artist excels in the treatment of fabrics, playing with their different hues, nuancing the shine from the satin ribbons, fluffy lightness of feathers on the hat and the relief embroidery adorning the shawl.",
    "images/PYNAS, Jacob Symonsz/Mercury and Herse.jpg": "Mercury, who has just punished the shepherd Battus for disloyalty, is flying over the farmlands and woods of Attica when he spots a procession of young girls wending their way to the sanctuary of Minerva. Conspicuous in the procession for her beauty is one of the daughters of Cecrops, Herse; the sight of her arouses instant passion in the god, who descends to earth in the hope of encountering her. The story ends with the transformation of the envious Aglauros, Herse's sister, into stone. His interpretation of the landscape, particularly the feathered leaves of the trees, the atmospheric depth and the presence of a small classical temple in the background, seems dependent on the brilliant prototypes mentioned above which date between 1610 and 1615.",
    "images/GRECO, El/The Purification of the Temple (4).jpg": "At the centre of the structure supporting the altarpiece is a tomb-like object with an obelisk. On the left there is a relief of the Expulsion of Adam and Eve, and above it a statue of a naked male figure who has been variously identified as Adam, his son Seth or an unidentified idol.",
    "images/HOOCH, Pieter de/Mother and Child by a Cradle.jpg": "The cooking pot over the fire suggests home and homely activities and underlines the peacefulness of the scene.",
    "images/FABRIS, Pietro/View of Paestum.jpg": "This painting presents a view of Paestum from the west with the temples of Poseidon and Ceres.",
    "images/SODOMA, Il/The Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple.jpg": "On the side walls of the room there is a series of large-scale fresco paintings separated from one another by pilasters decorated with candelabra motifs. The paintings depicts two sets of marble colonnades seen in sharp recession, thus providing a framework and focus for an important event taking place at some distance from the spectator.",
    "images/BELLOTTO, Bernardo/View of Warsaw from the Royal Palace (detail).jpg": "In front of the palace the terrace on the Vistula can be seen. Both on the staircase and the terrace the spectator's attention is attracted by numerous small figures. In the middle of the terrace there is a riding school, with a young man receiving a riding lesson, and on the right a sculptor's workshop is seen. The lighted Lubomirski Palace below the terrace on the left forms the transition to the middle distance.",
    "images/VIGÉE-LEBRUN, Élisabeth/Self-Portrait with Her Daughter, Julie.jpg": "Her self-portrait with her daughter is outstanding for the sweetness and simplicity of the attitudes.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Drusiana.jpg": "The scene depicting St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Drusiana is on the left wall of the chapel. The event takes place in the foreground, there are groupings of onlookers left and right. The background is like a theatre backdrop, a cityscape filled with towers, gates, and church façades that are more evocative of central Italy than classical antiquity.",
    "images/VERROCCHIO, Andrea del/The Baptism of Christ (detail).jpg": "The head is rendered almost academically, with the bones of the skull still implied, while the beard reveals a more naturalistic interest.",
    "images/BOUCHER, François/Diana Resting after her Bath.jpg": "The slender nudes and the hunting theme recall the School of Fontainebleau, of which certain traditions persist in the eighteenth century. The paint surface is intact, and the old varnish, which contains no artificial colouring, gives it a slightly golden tone.",
    "images/GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de/The Countess of Chinchón.jpg": "This fragile woman is looking shyly to one side. She was forced into marriage with Godoy, the Queen's lover, and holds her hands protectively over her pregnant belly.",
    "images/GUILLAUMIN, Armand/Still-Life.jpg": "This still-life depicts flowers, faience, and books.",
    "images/ROBERT, Hubert/Avenue in a Park.jpg": "An avenue lined with trees with their tops intertwined leads the spectator towards the bottom of the garden. In the centre, a young girl is playing on a swing, activated by two companions. A group of people to the right are looking on. The whole painting bathes in a soft harmony of browns, greys and greens against a bluish sky background. The red coat of the man leaning against the pedestal catches the viewer's eye. The antique statues - reposing satyr and faun playing a flute - flanking the tree-lined opening in the foreground had been earlier captured by Robert in a red chalk drawing of various Graeco-Roman sculptures conserved in the Capitol (Valence, Musée des Beaux Arts).",
    "images/LEYDEN, Lucas van/Card Players (2).jpg": "At the end of the earlier painted series of half-length pieces comes the version of the Card Players in the Wilton House. Like the others, this painting has all the marks of that frivolous genre of the Prodigal Son and other \"loose living\" compositions, with half-length figures of men and women in contemporary dress gathered around a table.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Supper at Emmaus.jpg": "The painting depicts the episode in which the now risen Christ, repeating the same act of breaking the bread that he had made during the Last Supper, is about to be recognized by two of his disciples. The elimination of the distance between painted event and spectator and the foreshortened contact with reality are effects created by the inclusion of portraits of people living at the time and participating in the event, and the large naked feet of the disciples in the lower part of the painting, where the heads of cats can be seen, their inquisitive gazes directed towards the onlooker. A crouching puppy can just be seen in the lower left corner of the painting.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Aristotele.jpg": "The side walls are also richly decorated with canvases by various hands representing the Philosophers.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/Deeds of Hercules and his Apotheosis.jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling fresco in the Hercules Hall of the Liechtenstein Garden Palace at Rossau.",
    "images/MOLENAER, Jan Miense/The Music-Makers.jpg": "In a plainly furnished room a young woman sits behind a table singing while the man sitting in the foreground plays a guitar. The colourful clothing of the music-makers, the still life composed by the objects on the table and the gently melancholic attitudes of the young people closeted together in this intimate corner of the room all contribute to the homely atmosphere of the picture.",
    "images/TRÜBNER, Wilhelm/On the Sofa.jpg": "The domestic scene has a proto-Matisse-like quality in the way the painter revels in a wealth of scintillating pattern - the red tablecloth, the blue patterned wall, the beflowered sofa cover.",
    "images/PACHER, Michael/St Lawrence Distributing the Alms.jpg": "The picture shows one of the panels of the St Lawrence Altarpiece.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Scenes from the Life of St Francis 4. Death and Ascension of St Francis (detail).jpg": "The remarkable foreshortening of the figure of the friar kissing the saint's hands is reminiscent of the foreshortening used in the sleeping soldier in the Resurrection of the Upper Church of San Francesco at Assisi.",
    "images/POTTER, Paulus/Cows in a Meadow by a Farm.jpg": "Scenes of herdsmen with cattle had been popular in Dutch painting since the 1620s, when they were painted mainly by the first generation of the so-called Italianates (e.g. Cornelis van Poelenburgh and Batholomeus Breenbergh). They placed their figures and animals in hilly, idealised landscapes, sometimes accompanied by classical nymphs and gods. Potter transported his pastoral from that ideal vision of Arcadia to 17th-century Dutch countryside, as illustrated by  Cows in a Meadow by a Farm.",
    "images/BOSSCHAERT, Ambrosius the Elder/Bouquet of Flowers (detail).jpg": "This painting depicts a bouquet of flowers in a stone arch opening onto a landscape.",
    "images/GAUGUIN, Paul/Eiaha ohipa (Not Working).jpg": "In this painting two Tahitian men are sitting in their hut, idly enjoying the taste of the tobacco. In the background the painter can be seen in long, white clothing, with a tropical hat.",
    "images/JORIS, Pio/The Fruit Vendor.jpg": "This scene of a street vendor observed in Rome expresses a sympathetic but dispassionate sense of isolation and despair. The woman has turned her gaze away from the viewer toward a man in uniform, seen from the back. A sense of unease or disappointment emanates from the twisted body of the woman, who seems to be getting up to leave her post at any moment.",
    "images/MEULEN, Adam Frans van der/The Taking of the Château de Joux.jpg": "The battle depicted in the painting was fought by Jacques-Henri de Durfort, the Duc de Duras (1625-1704), marshal of France, who is thought to be identifiable with the man on horseback in the red coat in the front left.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/The Judgment of Paris (1).jpg": "The scene depicts the story of his award of the golden apple to Venus in a contest of beauty between her, Juno, and Minerva.",
    "images/BROUWER, Adriaen/Village Scene with Men Drinking.jpg": "This picture portrays an outdoor drinking scene set on the outskirts of a village.",
    "images/GRECO, El/Mary Magdalen in Penitence (1).jpg": "Portrayed as a hermit saint, Mary Magdalen sits alone outside her cave, which according to legend was at St-Baume in southern France.",
    "images/MURA, Francesco de/Personification of Abundantia.jpg": "The picture shows Abundantia (Abundance) in one of the two corner cartouches of the ceiling. The Theological Virtues Fides and Caritas are placed opposite each other, and serve as visual links between the ceiling and the walls. Subordinate to these, in the corner cartouches of the ceiling, are four virtues, richly furnished with attributes and conceived as painted statues - Justitia, Mansuetudo, Abundantia, and Spes.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/View of the chapel vaulting.jpg": "Following convention, the four evangelists appear in the ceiling's cross-ribbed vaulting against a starry sky.",
    "images/PARROCEL, Joseph/The Boar Hunt.jpg": "This painting is one of a pair of hunting scenes: The Boar Hunt; The Return from the Hunt  A group of hunters, some on horseback and others on foot, attack a wild boar. The hunters' dogs join in the attack, whilst two horsewomen look on approvingly. In the background a man blows a bugle.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Christina of Denmark, Ducchess of Milan (detail).jpg": "Christina's black gown, which she wore as a widow, contrasts strikingly with her flawless ivory skin. The viewer's gaze is also attracted to the well-shaped, delicate hands holding a glove, leaving an impression of perfect charm and elegance.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Magpie on the Gallow (detail) (1).jpg": "Bruegel depicted a plain with fertile meadows and fields, people cheerfully dancing, and a village lying concealed in the shadow of a clifftop castle.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Deposition (detail) (4).jpg": "In the decoration of the upper left corner a bow can be seen.",
    "images/ZURBARÁN, Francisco de/St Elizabeth of Portugal.jpg": "He had already made his name, and was a court painter - though he had not yet come under the not altogether felicitous influence of Murillo - when he painted this Andalusian girl with her attractively irregular features, elegantly dressed in heavy, shimmering silks, wearing pearls and a coronet and holding roses in her hand, the only indication of her identity. Having hid bread to give away in her apron, she encountered King Diniz, who asked her what she was carrying. Not wanting to let on that the contents of her apron were meant for the poor, she responded that they were roses.",
    "images/MASTER of the Virgo inter Virgines/Virgin and Child with Sts Catherine, Cecilia, Barbara, and Ursula.jpg": "This painting, depicting the Virgin seated among four female martyrs, was probably painted for a nunnery. On the left is Catherine with the wheel on which she was tortured. Cecilia, behind her, has her organ, Barbara her tower, and Ursula is adorned with the arrow that pierced her heart.",
    "images/LAIRESSE, Gérard de/Allegory of the Five Senses.jpg": "Sight holds a mirror. Taste has a fruit and Smell a bunch of flowers. Touch has a bird perching on her raised hand.",
    "images/GUARDI, Francesco/Bacino di San Marco with San Giorgio and the Giudecca.jpg": "One of the artist's favourite subjects, enlivened here by his typical flittering play of slender brush strokes.",
    "images/VASARI, Giorgio/Ceiling decoration.jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling decoration of the Sala di Apollo (Apollo Room), one of the two bedrooms in the house. In the central tondo Apollo is depicted. The supporting vaults, two of which are shown here, represent the Nine Muses.",
    "images/LELY, Sir Peter/Henrietta Maria of France, Queen of England.jpg": "Lely portrays her here as a beautiful and dignified woman in royal dress with an expression of suffering on her lips and a look of aloof mourning in her eyes.",
    "images/BROEDERLAM, Melchior/The Flight into Egypt (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the Flight into Egypt on the right wing of the Dijon Altarpiece. The Virgin is seen in profile, riding side-saddle on a small donkey. She holds the baby Jesus pressed to her cheek. He is wrapped in swaddling bands, and she has drawn her large cloak up around him. The child and his mother are looking at each other. The heads of the Virgin and Child, unlike that of Joseph, are both surrounded by a golden halo.",
    "images/CÉZANNE, Paul/The Large Bathers (1).jpg": "The female creatures frolicking on the riverbank are not graceful, rather they are sturdy, angular, oddly proportioned and plump, and have nothing erotic about them.",
    "images/BRIL, Paul/Mountainous Landscape.jpg": "The painting depicts a mountainous landscape with wildlife around a cascade. It is an idealized view of nature, devoid of human figures or intervention:  animals including deer, rabbits, mountain goats, and a variety of birds have all gathered at the cascade.",
    "images/TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de/At the Moulin Rouge Two Women Waltzing.jpg": "Both the lithograph and the painting of this subject show the nude dancer and artist Cha-U-Kao (middle) dancing with a girlfriend, with Jane Avril to their right.",

    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Martyrdom of St Matthew (detail).jpg": "The picture's main figure is also half-naked. In terms of stroboscopic figures, his feet are level with the falling figure to his left. He has emerged from the depth of the picture to stand near the altar. Insofar as the murderer has associated himself with the half-naked man in the foreground, left, the fall of the latter suggests that his power will also be shortlived. He has thrown St Matthew, a bearded old man, to the ground. As a priest, he is wearing alb and chasuble. Whilst his victim helplessly props himself up on the ground, the Herculean youth seizes his wrist in his right hand, to hold the victim still for the death-blow. Yet the apostle's attempt to ward off his murderer, with his furious face, turns into a different gesture as an angel extends a martyr's palm-leaf to his open hand.",
    "images/GOLTZIUS, Hendrick/Jupiter and Antiope.jpg": "She was surprised by Jupiter in the form of a Satyr while she was asleep, and was ravished by him. The subject of the painting can be identified unambiguously by the inscription ANTIOPA on the golden cloth just below the right thigh of the reclining nude, and by the presence of Jupiter's thunderbolt by the satyr's left leg.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/The Risen Christ Appearing to Mary Magdalen (detail).jpg": "The landscape in the background is particularly fresh and beautiful.",
    "images/SCHEFFER, Ary/The Ghosts of Paolo and Francesca Appear to Dante and Virgil.jpg": "The painting illustrates a famous episode from the fifth canto of Dante's Inferno, in which Dante and Virgil see Paolo and Francesca condemned to the darkness of Hell with the souls of the lustful.",
    "images/CORTONA, Pietro da/Ceiling painting (4).jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling painting in the Sala di Marte. It depicts The Hero's Victory at Sea and Allegory of Peace. The Medici coat-of-arms, with its well-known arrangement of spheres in an oval, is prominently displayed at the centre of the ceiling. Next  to it is Mars, about to start war with a lightning bolt, and below him scenes of naval and land battles.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ignudo (7).jpg": "The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper right corner of the Sacrifice of Noah (above the prophet Isaiah). In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion. On the other hand, the ignudi on the right lean out toward the exterior, and the only difference between them appears to be the position of their arms.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/View of the main hall.jpg": "The the central section of the ceiling of the main hall is taken up by a celebratory image of Glory among the Cardinal Virtues. The the central section is flanked by images of Valour (to the left, with laurel wreath and sceptre, shown caressing a lion); and Intellect (with helmet and bow, to the right). In addition to those on the ceiling, four other virtues appear inside stucco frames on the walls of the room: Marital Harmony, Humility Casting Out Pride, Liberality Dispensing Gifts, and Virtue Crowning Honour.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Holy Family with St Anne.jpg": "Domestic happiness and intimacy are their dominate mood.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/View of the Sala di Udienza.jpg": "This picture shows the right and back walls of the Sala di Udienza in the Collegio del Cambio. On the back wall the scenes of the Transfiguration and the Adoration of the Shepherds can be seen, on the right wall the group of Prophets and Sibyls is depicted, and the statue of Justitia is placed between two carved griffins. Because of its vaulted ceiling decorated with grotesques, the Sala di Udienza (Council Room) seems taller than it actually is.",
    "images/SCHIELE, Egon/The Hermits.jpg": "This whole world, together with the two figures, is supposed to represent the transitoriness of everything essential. A single withered rose exhales its white innocence in contrast to the wreaths of flowers on the two heads. The figure on the right is said to represent Gustav Klimt, though there is no substantive evidence to support this identification. The resemblance between the figure on the left and Schiele is more apparent.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Democritus.jpg": "The subject of the painting is the Greek philosopher Democritus expressing his amusement at the world, which stands on the table in front of him in the shape of a globe. The man in the picture stands there smiling, shown half-length, turned to one side but with his face towards us. His right hand is placed on his hip, in an attitude setting off the heavy folds of a red cloak.",
    "images/FRANCKEN, Frans II/The Interior of a Picture Gallery with Connoisseurs Admiring Paintings.jpg": "The room is filled with a plethora of objects that illustrate the collector's eclectic and worldly taste. Various objets d'art, jewelry, shells, flowers, and a variety of paintings, both identifiable and in the general style of contemporary Flemish artists fill the room.",
    "images/FILARETE/Bronze door Back.jpg": "At the back of the door (bottom right) there is a strip of bronze, which depicts Filarete leading his assistants in a sort of dance. The figures are flanked by a man on a donkey and a man on a dromedary.",
    "images/FRANCKEN, Frans I/Jesus among the Doctors.jpg": "(The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.) The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem. His parents, who have found him after a long search, look somewhat dejected. The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background. The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild. The only reference to the Soap-boilers is in the right wing, where the Bible story of the Miracle of the Flowing Oil is depicted. The balanced composition with its symmetrically arranged groups and the restrained presentation of the principal theme, without many secondary scenes or symbols, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, the latest artistic trend at the time.",
    "images/BEACH, Thomas/Portrait of the Children of Charles Blair.jpg": "This painting represents Charles and Henry Blair, the children of Charles Blair and Lady Mary Fane, full length, wearing green and red suits of clothes, playing cup and ball in a landscape.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Madonna of Foligno (detail) (1).jpg": "Raphael portrays this event in the background.",
    "images/MOR VAN DASHORST, Anthonis/Perejón, Buffoon of the Count of Benavente and of the Grand Duke of Alba.jpg": "The artist depicts Pejerón full-length, life-size and in a three-quarter profile, standing before a dark background with no spatial references, a format subsequently adopted by Velázquez in Pablo de Valladolid. Only the large head, short legs, and deformed right hand holding the pack of cards indicate his occupation, 'the profession of jests'. With his characteristic objectivity and painstaking technique, Mor depicts Pejerón dressed as a courtier with a black doublet and cap, white breeches and hose, slashed shoes and a sword at his waist.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/The Annunciation (2).jpg": "Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. The lighting of the scene is curiously illogical, the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Last Supper (detail) (3).jpg": "On hearing Christ's claim that the traitor is among them, the two Apostles on the far right appear to be asking each other: \"Am I the one?\" - and others are becoming melancholic.",
    "images/GIORGIONE/The Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "The composition is divided into two parts, the dark cave on the right and a luminous Venetian landscape on the left. The shimmering draperies of Joseph and Mary are set off by the darkness behind them, and are also contrasted with the tattered dress of the shepherds. The scene is one of intense meditation; the rustic shepherds are the first to recognize Christ's divinity and they kneel accordingly. Mary and Joseph also participate in the adoration, creating an atmosphere of intimacy.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Ambrogio/Effects of Good Government on the City Life (detail).jpg": "The subject of the frescoes are the Good and Bad Government and their effects on the life of the cities and villages. This detail shows the centre of the city. In the middle the dancing young women probably represent the nine Muses. There are several genre like scenes in the picture (shops, chatting men, riders, working men on the roof etc.)",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Conversion of Saul.jpg": "This large canvas shows the conversion of Saul, formerly a persecutor of Christians and later known as Paul, when he was flung to the ground by a bright light on his way to Damascus, blinded, and addressed by the loud voice of God.",
    "images/VRIES, Roelof van/View of a Village.jpg": "This panel shows a view of a village across a river, with a man fishing in the foreground.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas over the Heretics (detail) (1).jpg": "In the background the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius (today on the Capitoline Hill) can be seen in its original site in front of the basilica of San Giovanni Laterano. In the foreground are the defeated heretics, among which can be identified Arius, Apollinarius, and Averroes.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Pilgrims Meet the Pope.jpg": "The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls.",
    "images/DOMENICO DI MICHELINO/Dante and the Three Kingdoms (detail).jpg": "In this painting the three kingdoms are represented: the Purgatory in the centre background, the Hell at left, and the heavenly City at right.",
    "images/URBANI, Andrea/Sleeping Eros with a Putto and Doves in a Starry Landscape.jpg": "The north wall depicts Sleeping Eros with a Putto and Doves in a Starry Landscape; the east wall, a Landscape with a Stone Bridge and Isolated Cottage by the Light of Dawn; the south wall, a broad daylight scene with The Swan Attacked by Dogs; and the west wall, a Landscape with a Small Village and Fleeing Wolves at Sunset.",
    "images/ROBERTI, Ercole de'/Griffoni Polyptych Predella (right view).jpg": "The predella shows the miracles of the saint as successive scenes in a long line.",
    "images/FRAGONARD, Jean-Honoré/Match to Powderkeg (Le feu aux poudres).jpg": "They celebrate an adolescent pleasure, a rare ensemble in which the thrill of desire is exalted without the least trace of vulgarity.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Noli me Tangere (detail).jpg": "The foreground is dominated by the two principal figures who surprise one another in front of the tomb depicted on the right. Behind in the middle distance are two disciples, Saint Peter and Saint John, making their way to Jerusalem which can be espied in the valley below. On the left is Calvary where, unusually, the artist has shown more than three crosses. The scene is carefully composed, with the verticals established by the risen Christ and Mary Magdalen continued by the trees. The dialogue between the main figures is echoed by the poses of the two disciples, whose forms are contained in the space between the chief protagonists. As the disciples hurry away so they lead the eye down the hill and over the distant landscape. Other features though, such as the sombre colours, the distinctive faces with high foreheads, long noses and small chins, the fast moving clouds seen between the trees, and the luminous interior of the tomb reveal the residual influence of the elder Holbein, as well as of Hans Baldung Grien and Hans Burgkmair. Rowlands contends that the Magdalen is dressed in the French fashion and that the ointment jar is recognisable as French faience.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/8. Battle between Heraclius and Chosroes (detail) (10).jpg": "To the far right, before the large canopy that arches over in the space above the blasphemous throne of Chosroes, the final episode of the cycle unfolds, with the sentencing to death of the Persian king. The defeated king, wearing his crown, is kneeling, old, white-haired, wrapped in a mantle that restoration has revealed to bee of very bright blue colour. Next to him stand Emperor Heraclius, who grasps the staff of command as he condemns him, and a series of Piero's contemporaries believed to be portraits of the Bacci family, who commissioned the artist to do the paintings in the chapel",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Alliance Coat of Arms of the Dürer and Holper Families.jpg": "The picture shows the rear view of the Portrait of Albrecht Dürer the Elder. The family's coat of arms depicts an open barn door on the left, which was presumably a symbol of the family name.",
    "images/MASO DI BANCO/The Miracle of the Dragon (1).jpg": "The scene at the bottom of the south wall shows the Miracle of the Dragon. The scene of the \"dragon miracle\" takes place in Rome beetween the ruins of the Forum Romanum. The deep space is divided into three parts. On the left the Pope puts the dragon on chains then he turns toward the dead Magi and raises them from the dead. Emperor Constantine and his accompaniment occupy the right side of the scene in astonishment.",
    "images/BRETON, Jules/Water Carriers.jpg": "The costume of the two girls and the landscape suggests the Amalfi coast, or Capri as the setting of the scene.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Crucifixion of Saint Peter (detail).jpg": "There are three executioners who fit into a criss-cross pattern, each marked out by the colours of their clothes. They are made anonymous, for two men have their backs to the spectator and the eyes of the third (on the picture) are in darkness.",
    "images/UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Greek/Christ Pantocrator.jpg": "Christ is shown holding a Gospel in his left hand while the right is raised in a gesture of blessing.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Grand Canal Looking from Palazzo Balbi.jpg": "The artist shows the bridge in the veduta that looks out to the north-east from Palazzo Balbi. Canaletto shows on the far left a section of the Palazzo Balbi, to the right the Palazzo Contarini dalle Figure and the four palazzi of the Mocenigo family. In the distance we can see the Rialto Bridge, and beyond that to the right the roof of the church of SS. The gondola, readied for a delightful picnic trip, is the scene of a marital drama, for the ugly old woman is clearly beating the man over his pointed hat with her oar, as he holds a tightly bundled infant out to her imploringly.",
    "images/MACCHIETTI, Girolamo/Baths at Pozzuoli.jpg": "The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.",
    "images/CHARDIN, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon/Young Sketcher.jpg": "His Young Sketcher, seen from behind copying a large red chalk drawing, represents a somewhat ironic image of the pupil at work.",
    "images/MASTER of San Francesco Bardi/St Francis Receiving the Stigmata (1).jpg": "Note, for example, the naturalness of the surroundings, with the hill and the temple rising above and almost holding up the kneeling saint as if to emphasize his bodily weight.",
    "images/DESPORTES, Alexandre-François/Still-Life.jpg": "The painting depicts a still-life with a monkey and a basket of fruit all resting on a ledge with a landscape beyond.",
    "images/BECCAFUMI, Domenico/Fall of the Rebel Angels (1).jpg": "The earlier of these two versions of the expulsion of the rebel angels from heaven by the Archangel Michael is at first sight difficult to read: the lower part of the painting is dominated by the tall, elongated figures of three standing nude men. It requires some effort to discern that, within the gloom that surrounds them, other figures are shown in convoluted poses. In the upper part of the painting, encircled by a swirling mass of flying angels, is the arresting figure of Saint Michael. Clad in fanciful antique armour, he holds his sword aloft as a sign of his victory over the vanquished rebel angels. Above him in turn appears an extraordinarily daring representation of God, portrayed in extreme foreshortening. The bright red of his voluminous mantle and the golden hemisphere behind him ensure that this figure dominates the composition as a whole. The angelic company is organised into an orderly choir of seated figures surrounding God, with only a few of their companions engaged in expelling the rebel angels. Although still holding a sword above his head, he has been divested of armour and appears in a pale pink and golden yellow tunic, tied across the chest with pale blue ribbons. Beneath him, the fallen angels recline in a series of subterranean vaults lit by sulphurous light. The devil has been transformed into a snarling monstrous beast that has the appearance of a classical chimaera.",
    "images/POCCETTI, Bernardino/Ceiling fresco.jpg": "The ceiling fresco of the Large grotto depicts an open trellis inhabited by an array of wild animals, in their midst a smiling Bacchus or Silenus who is throwing an inviting glance down at the viewer.",
    "images/MUNKÁCSY, Mihály/Christ before Pilate.jpg": "The picture shows a victorious Christ who is standing in the middle with a radiant whiteness and defeats his spiteful enemies and the hesitating Roman governor.",
    "images/RUYSDAEL, Salomon van/Marine.jpg": "On the left bank of the river is a village and a Late Gothic church of a type common in Holland. On the right bank, a boat with lowered sails is moored by a farmhouse. The sailboat in the foreground, flying the Dutch flag, is a 'schouw', one of a few types of shallow-draft vessel that were used to ship goods and occasionally passengers between towns on the inland waterways.",
    "images/VOET, Jacob Ferdinand/Portrait of Anna Maria Carpegna Naro.jpg": "The sitter is represented half length, wearing a dress with fine lace and pink bows.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) (17).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the right wing which represents the Monk's Level (after Fraenger).",
    "images/LOO, Charles-Amédée-Philippe van/Soap Bubbles.jpg": "In both paintings, three children appear in a trompe-l'oeil oval window in a painted stone wall. Each figure appears at a different height, but the three are tightly clustered to form a pyramidal composition. With rapt attention that connects them psychologically, the children observe their toys or games.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Venus Blindfolding Cupid.jpg": "In fact, the work depicts Venus blindfolding Cupid, the little god of love, and two nymphs who bring Cupid s bow and arrows. The painting evokes Cupid's blind power as his mother, the cosmic divinity, blindfolds him. His brother is intent on observing the large number of arrows or fatal darts of love (a metaphor for amorous glances) the nymph is carrying.",
    "images/HELMONT, Mattheus van/Liberation of St Peter.jpg": "In this picture the painter has relegated the miraculous episode from the life of St peter to the background, focusing instead on the foreground, in which sits a group of soldiers, reminiscent of the popular tavern scenes painted by Teniers, Brouwer and others.",
    "images/FONTEBASSO, Francesco/Family of Darius before Alexander.jpg": "This painting depicts one of the many events surrounding Alexander the Great's defeat of the Persian Emperor Darius in 330 BCE, which was one of the most popular narratives in 18th-century art. Hephaestion gestures toward Alexander, attempting to end the confusion. Darius's wife is terribly moved by the sight of her husband's great enemy and is wiping her tears, while the two daughters and son look more interested than frightened. All of these artists included a young boy holding a shield on the lower right and the bowing figure of the queen to the left of her husband's foes. The decorative scene seems to be taking place on stage and speaks of the exuberance and drama of the age.",
    "images/COROT, Jean-Baptiste Camille/Peasants under the Trees at Dawn.jpg": "A peasant saws timber; his wife helps him. Trees and distant village buildings are silhouetted against the sky, irradiated with the fresh cool light of early morning, and long shadows fall on the grass, where we can just make out a glint of white plumage on the back of a goose with dun-feathered wings waddling out to graze.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Marriage at Cana.jpg": "The wedding breakfast has a distinctly sober atmosphere, as the miracle has yet to take place. The cups are empty, the bride and groom are worried, and their guests are puzzled. Christ, who is in the middle distance, but highlighted by the perspective of the table, will shortly restore everybody's good humour.",
    "images/CESARI, Giuseppe/Christ Taken Prisoner.jpg": "Cesari bathes the scene in a pale moonlight that gives the colours an almost metallic coolness.",

    "images/PAOLO VENEZIANO/Polyptych (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows the right side of the polyptych with the scenes 'The Journey to Calvary', 'The Crucifixion', 'The Resurrection and the encounter with Mary Magdalene' and 'The Ascension'. Above these scenes, set between Evangelists, are scenes depicting, from left to right: 'The Stigmata of St Francis', 'The Death of St Francis' and 'Christ in Judgment'. At top left is the Prophet Daniel.",

    "images/GIOVANNI DI PAOLO/St Catherine of Siena Exchanging Her Heart with Christ.jpg": "This picture illustrates St Catherine's miraculous levitation and exchange of her bloody heart with Christ. The small church alongside which Catherine levitates has an open door, above which is a figure of Christ as the Man of Sorrows - a poignant contrast to his appearance to Catherine, his hand raised in blessing while she holds a bleeding heart.",
    "images/SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo/Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "Particularly noteworthy is the contrast of the dark background and the brilliantly yet softly illuminated figures in the foreground.",
    "images/PATENIER, Joachim/Crossing the River Styx.jpg": "Typically the landscape is enlivened by dramatic effects of wheather or the outbreak of fire, in a manner influenced by Bosch.",
    "images/CORREGGIO/The Education of Cupid.jpg": "The blurred contours, veiled transitions from rosy shadow to gold and white highlight and from flesh to feather, and the elusive mood of 'The School of Love' recall Giorgione, but Leonardo's influence is also evident in the exquisitely silky hair, the dreamy smiles, the complex pose of Venus.",
    "images/MOMPER, Joos de/Landscape.jpg": "The familiar formula of placing browns in the foreground, greens in the middle and light blues in the background establishes the sense of aerial space; also the dark shapes of flying birds against the hazy blues and whites of the sky compound the effect. In the foreground comes the usual picturesque group of figures.",
    "images/GADDI, Agnolo/Recovery of the Wood (left) from Which the True Cross is Constructed.jpg": "In the third image field from the top on the south wall - as in all four frescoes on the south wall - two scenes are combined. The wood, buried earlier by Solomon, floats to the surface of a pond where many who had fallen ill sought to be cured. Jews pull the wood from the water and construct from it the True Cross. In this image, elaborately designed architectural backdrops form the background. To the left is a hospital in which many bedridden patients are seen, some paying close attention to the recovery of the wood. On the right is a religious building, which may be the Temple of Solomon.",
    "images/ENSOR, James/Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889.jpg": "James Ensor took on religion, politics, and art in this scene of Christ entering contemporary Brussels in a Mardi Gras parade. Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer - a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, and caricatures. Public, historical, and allegorical figures, along with the artist's family and friends, make up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the centre of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functions as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed - a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littré, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton and leading on the eager, mindless crowd. Above the crowd is a political banner bearing the legend Vive la Sociale ('Long live the Welfare State'); the implication is that Christ's message, like Ensor's, is not being heeded. Parody becomes a nightmare when one notices, lurking among the masks on the left foreground, the figure of Death in a top hat.",
    "images/BOUTS, Dieric the Elder/The Last Supper (detail) (2).jpg": "Moreover, the space is not entirely enclosed, for the outside world is visible at two points: once through the windows to the left, through which distant houses are visible, and again through the arch at the back of the room. This latter opening gives onto an enclosed garden painted in blue and pink tones, as if space were stretching out across it towards an invisible horizon.",
    "images/SUSTRIS, Lambert/Perseus and Andromeda.jpg": "This painting with trompe l'oeil shaped corners depicts It depicts Perseus freeing the naked Andromeda from the rock to which she has been tied, whilst the sea monster Cetus lurks nearby. In the background is the winged horse Pegasus, whom Perseus is often depicted with.",
    "images/AACHEN, Hans von/Bacchus, Ceres and Cupid.jpg": "Bacchus (wine) Venus freezes. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits. The nude figure of a woman viewed from behind, a favourite motif in Rudolfine art, is represented here in a sensually suggestive way.",
    "images/FLÉMAL, Bertholet/Allegory of the Foundation of Rome.jpg": "The helmeted divinity - serious, aloof, and of masculine beauty - sits enthroned in her chariot amidst the accoutrements of battle, including standards, trophies, and conquered adversaries. In her right hand, she holds a Victoriola, a small cult statute of Victory. A statue of the she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of the city, is visible in the background.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Adam; Cain and Abel.jpg": "At the far left of the composition is the figure of Adam, set into a trompe-l'oeil niche. At the top, the scene of Cain and Abel is represented in grisaille.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/The Fur (Het Pelsken).jpg": "In tones worthy of Titian, he painted Helene with curly hair, her nipples erect, her nudity barely concealed by a fur wrap better suited to her husband's bulk than her own. Helene is standing on a red cloth and is wrapping herself, apparently spontaneously with a white cloth and a fur cloak. She is holding both in such a way that each arm crosses in front of her body covering the pelvic region, but pushing her breasts up in the crook of her right arm. Here, together with the face, the intimate gaze of the painter is betrayed.",
    "images/KAUFFMANN, Angelica/Portrait of a Woman as a Vestal Virgin.jpg": "In this painting, the young woman is dressed as a vestal virgin - one of the maidens who looked after the Temple of Minerva - offering a sacrifice to the goddess, whose sculpted image appears in the background.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Madonna and Child with Angels.jpg": "In place of the intricate Gothic archivolts with narratives that Rogier painted, a heavier and more classical arch appears with Italian putti often holding garlands so familiar in Renaissance art.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/Bakery and butcher shop.jpg": "On the left wall of the first bay of the loggia, above a door, another interior is presented, but in this one, men are working behind to large counters, at left in a bakery, at right in a butcher shop.",

    "images/RIPPL-RÓNAI, József/Skittle-players.jpg": "The figures, delineated with just a few bare contours and dark areas of colour, bear witness to the calm and economy of motion that attracted Rippl-Rónai to the game.",
    "images/GADDI, Agnolo/Emperor Heraclius Beheads Chosroës and Enters Jerusalem with the True Cross (1).jpg": "On the two side walls the story of the Saint Cross is depicted, the Triumph of the Cross being the final and most significant scene of the cycle. There are three scenes depicted beside and above each other. On the left side the beheading of Chosroes, King of Persia, for the occupation of Jerusalem and robbing the Cross; behind and above Heraclios arriving to Jerusalem with the regained Cross; on the right side Heraclios bringing the Cross barefooted into Jerusalem. The majority of the figures are illustrated in profile. Traditionally it is believed that the man standing beside the executioner is the painter himself.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Famous Men of Antiquity (detail).jpg": "The Cardinal Virtue Prudentia is above them.",
    "images/VALENTIN DE BOULOGNE/The Last Supper.jpg": "The painting shows the most dramatic moment of the Last Supper, when Jesus reveals to the disquieted apostles that one of them would betray him. Beside Christ, St John rests his head on the table and sleeps, in keeping with an iconographic tradition popular in Emilia. Meanwhile Peter, to the left of Christ, raises his hands in a gesture of astonishment. In the left foreground, Judas can be seen holding a purse behind his back: this contains thirty coins, the price of his treachery. His compositional scheme shows classical influence, with the solemn and monumental figure of Christ at the exact centre of the scene and the symmetric composition around him, with the apostles distributed regularly around the table. Likewise, light enlivens the simple but effective still life that seems to spring forth from the white tablecloth.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, French/The Calvinist Temple at Lyon.jpg": "Instead of an altar, the pulpit is the focus of the service.",
    "images/WERFF, Adriaen van der/Holy Family.jpg": "This family scene shows what it is possible to achieve in this life.",
    "images/LOUTHERBOURG, Philip Jacques de/Seascape with Sunset.jpg": "The entire left half of the painting is taken up by craggy, towering cliffs with a fortress set prominently on their steep slopes and by a distant town. On the right-hand side, there is a view of a Dutch frigate, behind which the seascape dissolves in the hazy southern atmosphere and the setting sun. In the foreground, a number of fishermen, engaged in various activities, give the painting the necessary natural touch.",
    "images/APPIANI, Andrea/General Desaix.jpg": "Rather than Italy, it is his former service in Egypt, where he had earned his nickname of 'Just Sultan', that is acknowledged by the two turbaned Mamluks, and he appears in a peaceful role, with sword sheathed and in civilian clothes.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (1).jpg": "Wearing wings held together with wax, Icarus approached too close to the sun; the wax melted, and Icarus fell into the sea. Bruegel makes him look ridiculous, depicting merely his thrashing legs. Through the farmer, the shepherd and the angler, he is promulgating Stoic ideas: one should not rebel against the laws of the cosmos, but should be content to fulfil one's tasks in the appointed place.",
    "images/BABUREN, Dirck van/Christ Washing the Apostles Feet.jpg": "St Peter's pose, as he protests that Christ should not lower himself to such a humble role, anticipates the violently active figures Bernini sculpted on some of his Roman fountain bases.",
    "images/ROSA, Salvator/View of the Gulf of Salerno.jpg": "His craggy cliffs, jagged, moss-laden trees, and rough bravura handling create a dank and desolate air that contrasts sharply with the serenity of Claude Lorrain or the classical grandeur of Nicolas Poussin.",
    "images/FRANCIA, Francesco/View of the Oratory (1).jpg": "The picture shows a view looking toward the altar wall and the north wall with scenes 1-5 of the St Cecilia cycle. The cycle begins to the left of the altar. The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves. Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)",

On the west wall is the Last Judgment, on the south wall (left) the Paradise, on the north wall (right) the Hell can be seen. The figures in the stained glass window are the Madonna and Child, and the Dominican Saint Thomas Aquinas.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Ecce Homo.jpg": "The figure of Pilate is an assumed self-portrait of Caravaggio.",
    "images/MELZI, Francesco/Pomona and Vertumnus.jpg": "Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple. His face is that of an old man, only the bonnet identifies him as an old woman. The feet and hands are those of a young person. The motif of his gait, due to which his garments are still fluttering, shows that he has just arrived. At the point where his right wrist is bent, the grapevine is entwined around the elm. The gentle touch of her shoulder with his youthful hand depicts the moment at which he reveals himself to her. Pomona's eyes are still lowered longingly while he is already gazing at her passionately.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Moses Drawing Water from the Rock (detail) (1).jpg": "In setting the battle with the Amalekites apart from the darker foreground by its pale pastel colours, Tintoretto puts spatial and temporal distance between the battle and the miracle of the water.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 4 Scenes from the Life of Joachim 4. Joachim's Sacrificial Offering.jpg": "In the open countryside, Joachim has sunk to the ground and catches sight of an angel, who indicates to him that his sacrifice has been accepted. As so often, Giotto also employs a figure here who comments on the action — the praying shepherd. In his colorings, he is closer to the rocks and the animals. He too recognizes the hand of benediction in the sky.",
    "images/MASTER of the Acts of Mercy/Feeding the Hungry (exterior).jpg": "This double-sided panel shows on one side The Feast of Herod and on the other Feeding the Hungry.",
    "images/RENI, Guido/Mary Sewing the Shirt for the Christ Child (Service in the Temple).jpg": "Mary, wearing a red dress and with her hair falling loosely across her shoulders, is bent over her sewing. She is framed by two adult angels while above her hover two putti with inscription ribbons alluding to her predestined role as mother of God (VOCAVIT IS QUI VOCAT EAM A PRINCIPIO). The seven putti above were painted by Francesco Albani.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/The Four Corners of the World America.jpg": "On the ceiling of the nave St Ignatius is depicted in a state of ecstasy, and functions as a mediator between heaven and earth. Issuing from his heart are four rays of flame radiating outwards toward elaborate animated groupings representing the four corners of the globe. These personifications sit enthroned above monstrous giants.",
    "images/ANTONIO DA FIRENZE/Madonna and Child with Saints.jpg": "The picture shows one side of a panel painted on both sides. The other side represents the Crucifixion with Mary and St John the Evangelist.",

    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/San Zeno Polyptych (central panel).jpg": "The central section of the San Zeno Altarpiece depicts the Madonna holding her Child and surrounded by music-making angels, seated on a marble throne decorated with Roman-inspired reliefs. The naturalistic trompe l'oeil garlands, seemingly affixed to the top of the picture, create a rapport with the garlands held by the putti in the marble relief at the top of the throne.",
    "images/PARET Y ALCAZÁR, Luis/View of El Arenal in Bilbao.jpg": "View of El Arenal in Bilbao depicts a scene enlivened by the presence of stevedores and traders, chatting and carting goods amidst other merchandise and luggage in the foreground of the composition. The estuary of the river Nervión is enhanced behind the figures, while on the right the wharf is demarcated by a parapet.",
    "images/MULTSCHER, Hans/Prayer on the Mount of Olives.jpg": "The sequence opens with Christ's prayer on the Mount of Olives. The Roman procurator has just pronounced the death sentence and is washing his hands as  a sign that he is innocent of the death of the Lord. The next scene is of Christ carrying the cross to Calvary. The sequence concludes with Christ's resurrection.",
    "images/JACOPO del SELLAIO/St John the Baptist.jpg": "St John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, although always portrayed as an ascetic in a hair shirt, was represented in several ways by the city's artists, from the sullen and reserved prophet - as he was usually shown by painters of the Trecento - to the exalted, over-refined figure of Botticelli, which inspired the painter of the present picture.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Peasant Wedding.jpg": "The wedding feast is dominated by the figure of the bride who, radiant and composed, presides over the table beneath a canopy. Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk. The monk has presumably just conducted the service of marriage and it has been suggested that he is tediously reminiscing about previous weddings he has attended to the local landowner.",
    "images/SALTINI, Pietro/Simone Memmi Drawing Laura's Portrait for Petrarch.jpg": "In this imaginary historical event, the painter evokes the atmosphere of fourteenth-century Italy. The great poet Petrarch, shown seated in the foreground in a red garb, presumably commissioned the artist Simone Memmi to draw a portrait of the poet's beloved Laura, whose identity - if she ever actually existed - has never been established, but who served as his muse in many of his most beautiful love poems.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Portrait of Almorò Barbaro.jpg": "In the Sala dell'Olimpo, Veronese configured the lower part of the vault as a loggia, and standing the balustrade of this loggia are various figures dressed in contemporary clothing. Two sons of Marcantonio and Giustiniana Giustiniani, Almorò, born in 1548 and Daniele, born in 1551, appear in the loggia, Almorò shown reading, Daniele attempting the hold back the dog that is determined to chase after the monkey climbing at the centre of the balustrade.",
    "images/MASTER of 1336/Madonna della Misericordia.jpg": "The cloak was a symbol of protection dating back to Antiquity, and beneath it the diminutive penitents seek the Madonna's protection against misfortune and her intercession for divine judgement. The presence of a friar and nun at the forefront hints at a possible Dominican commission.",
    "images/SASSETTA/Death of the Heretic on the Bonfire.jpg": "The picture shows one of the predella paintings of the Altar of the Eucharist by Sassetta.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Domine quo vadis.jpg": "It is not the unexpected encounter with the risen Christ that has taken the apostle aback, but his awareness of his own human frailty. The viewer is on the Appian Way with Peter, or rather, is Peter meeting Christ. The foot of the cross protrudes from the panel, Christ's hand points outwards, and the shadows he casts attest to his corporeality as he strides toward us. It is obvious that this figure was based on a live model, for his hands and lower legs are more sunburnt than his torso and thighs, although the face he turns to Peter is an idealised mask of pathos under the crown of thorns. Despite the dual sources of light from the background and in the foreground, the same sun seems to warm sky, trees, fields and Roman temples, and the crimson, white, gold and blue draperies, the metal keys, the youthful and the aged flesh and the chestnut and grizzled hair of the two wayfarers at the crossroads between time and eternity.",

    "images/GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de/Les Jeunes or the Young Ones.jpg": "The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait. One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings.",
    "images/BOUTS, Dieric the Elder/The Execution of the Innocent Count (detail).jpg": "The count, dressed in white, barefoot and his hands bound, is led out to his execution. Several figures, including a Franciscan monk, accompany the condemned man, who is giving his last instructions to his wife as he walks.",
    "images/LEYDEN, Lucas van/Lot and his Daughters.jpg": "Alongside the group in the foreground, the destruction of Sodom seen in the left-hand background establishes a second point of focus.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Ceiling Oculus.jpg": "Created with sharp foreshortenings, the oculus is ringed with figures looking down on the room below; a potted plant is precariously perched on its wooden support, seemingly ready to fall at any moment.",

    "images/GENTILE DA FABRIANO/Annunciation.jpg": "The scene takes place in a room enclosed on three sides and opened in front as if by a portico. The room is lit by little rose windows and other windows of elaborate Gothic design. A frieze of miniature trefoil arches runs along the upper cornice of the room, defining the front edge of its coffered ceiling. An open arched doorway, through which the angel enters, admits to a garden, in which trees laden with fruit can be glimpsed to the far left. The Virgin is startled by the angel's annunciation as she sits, hands folded in her lap and open prayer book beside her, on an L-shaped settle, richly ornamented with intarsia panels in the shape of diamonds, lozenges, and intersecting circles.",
    "images/BERGAMASCO, Il/View of the vault.jpg": "In the central panel on the vault a celestial scene opens up: on clouds, the assembly of the Olympian gods convenes. Minerva and Mercury gesticulate in a prominent central position, championing the fate of Odysseus. Around the central fresco are grouped, in variously divided and richly ornamented adiculae, episodes from the story of Odysseus's return home, which was decided in the council of the gods. The scenes are: Odysseus and Nausicaa; Odysseus in the Stone-Throwing Contest at the Phaeacian Court; Odysseus and Minerva; and Odysseus Slays the Suitors in His Palace at Ithaca.",

    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Christ in the House of Mary and Martha.jpg": "Even the plump, ruddy-cheeked figure of Martha and the still-life arrangement of fish, garlic, eggs and paprika, recall examples of Northern European art. The events reflected in the mirror, bathed in a mild light and exuding an atmosphere peace and calm, are contrasted with the foreground image of loud and busy work. She is not concentrating on her work, but gazes full of yearning, on the verge of tears, and slightly angrily, as though she already realized that Mary had chosen the better part.",
    "images/DENIS, Maurice/The Legend of St Hubert 4. The Miracle.jpg": "The picture shows The Miracle, panel 4 from the series of 7 with unique compositions that share imagery, colour harmony and decorative motifs.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "The depiction of the Virgin, with her fluttering robe and swirling head-dress, is graceful and lively. She is borne up to heaven in a cloud by playful putti. Two angels at the top left of the painting are about to crown her with a garland of roses. The twelve apostles stand around her sarcophagus at the bottom. The attractive woman in the middle, wearing a red dress, is given greater prominence than the other bystanders.",
    "images/MASTER of Flémalle/Portrait of a Fat Man.jpg": "The daring white background is calculated to heighten every aspect of the sitter's jowly, stubbly physiognomy, his ducal ties indicated by the court's characteristic short haircut and fur-trimmed robes.",
    "images/ANTONIAZZO ROMANO/Madonna Enthroned with the Infant Christ and Saints.jpg": "The Madonna is flanked by St Paul and St Francis.",
    "images/PALMA GIOVANE/Allegory of the Victory over the League of Cambrai (detail).jpg": "The canvas depicts Doge Leonardo Loredan and represents the Venetians' resistance to the combined powers of Europe, symbolized by allegorical figures.",

    "images/BERGHE, Christoffel van den/Flowers in a Porcelain Vase.jpg": "The present flower piece depicts tulips, roses, narcissi, daffodils, crocuses, an iris, a poppy and other flowers in a gilt mounted porcelain vase on a ledge, with a queen of Spain fritillary, a white ermine and a magpie butterfly.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Crucifixion with Mourners and Sts Dominic and Thomas Aquinas (Cell 37).jpg": "The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. In six cells Fra Angelico included the grieving Virgin and other mourners along with St Dominic or Peter martyr to cue the beholder's response.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Venus and Psyche.jpg": "The triangular supports of the vault contain the deities involved and their attributes are displayed by the 'amorini' hovering nearby.",
    "images/GELDORP, Georg/Martha Bertie (née Cockayne), Countess of Lindsey.jpg": "This portrait captures the rich heiress at a pivotal moment in her life: the year of her second marriage to Montagu Bertie. She wears a black over-gown with a bodice and skirt of embroidered oyster silk, tied with striped ribbon at the waist. This ribbon also keeps in place the paned and padded figure-of-eight sleeves known as 'virago' sleeves. As a truly fashionable English beauty, Martha has taken as much care in choosing her accessories as she did her dress; the large double-collar, the feathers in her hair, and a black ostrich feather fan completing her costume. She stands by a chair under a red canopy, and the landscape beyond shows a withered tree stump, perhaps a symbolic reference to her recently deceased first husband and their childless marriage.",
    "images/HALS, Frans/Portrait of a Man (15).jpg": "The pictures become darker, the blacks richer and more predominant.",
    "images/ROTARI, Pietro Antonio/King Augustus III of Poland.jpg": "Rotari's portrait shows the monarch wearing his breastplate under a blue coat and supporting his left hand on his staff, with before him part of his ermine robe. Set resplendently on his chest is the Catholic Order of the Golden Fleece, and almost completely obscured on the lower left is the Polish Order of the White Eagle hanging on a blue ribbon.",
    "images/VERSCHUUR, Wouter/A Moment of Rest.jpg": "His favourite subjects were horses, and in the present picture the two draught horses form a dignified and docile pair, with the last of the sun's rays reflecting off their muscular flanks and thick manes.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices (1).jpg": "The sculpturally rounded figures stand out dramatically against the blue of the sky.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Erasmus.jpg": "As in the Basel portrait, Holbein here depicts Erasmus as the learned author actively pursuing his vocation as a writer - his gaze is lowered and he focuses entirely on the text he is writing. Here, as in other portraits of him, we see the great master of North European humanism in his self appointed role as educational conscience of the age.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Spanish/The Annunciation.jpg": "The lack of perspective seems unimportant where there is such a decorative use of colour for the garments, and the vase with three lilies distracts us from the clumsy proportions of the figure of Mary.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Madonna and Child with Two Angels (1).jpg": "The delicate profile of the Virgin Mary, seated by the window, is outlined clearly against the rocky landscape, while two angels hold up the Christ Child, who reaches toward his praying mother. The angel in the foreground turns with an odd smile toward the spectator.",
    "images/GHERARDINI, Tommaso/Wall decoration (1).jpg": "The picture shows the wall decoration in the room in the southwest corner of the west wing in the Villa Poggio Imperiale. This room is fascinating for its exquisite grotesque decoration covering the full height of the walls and the greater part of the vault. Its lively, symmetrical, fragile-looking motifs include griffins, masks, baskets of fruit, animals, garlands, rosettes, and other delicate plant forms.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Portrait of a White-Bearded Man.jpg": "Here, only the head and hand emerge in an eerily life-like fashion from the darkness of eternal night.",
    "images/HULSDONCK, Jacob van/Still-Life (1).jpg": "The picture shows a still-life with peaches, plums and grapes in a wan-li porcelain dish, all upon a ledge partially draped with a green cloth.",
    "images/MASTER of the Blue Jeans/A Meal with a Woman and Two Children.jpg": "This painting depicts a woman - no longer young - seated on the ground, accompanied by two children. All three appear to be of a humble social  class, dressed as they are in rural clothing, and with both  children wearing threadbare, torn clothes. The painter focused on these three figures, whose dress is the subject of detailed description, carried out with especially painstaking  care.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Boy with a Basket of Fruit (detail).jpg": "Against a near-blank ground, attention is focused on the marvellously realized fruit, displaying succulent peaches and bunches of grapes.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/St John Altarpiece.jpg": "The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/The Damned Being Plunged into Hell (detail) (1).jpg": "The splendid group in the foreground depicts the devil whipping a terrified, screaming sinner (reminiscent of a Pollaiolo figure).",
    "images/COSSA, Francesco del/Griffoni Polyptych St John the Baptist.jpg": "This affinity emerges behind the standing figure of John the Baptist in a landscape of rocky pinnacles, open arcades, and natural bridges supporting turreted castles and domed churches stacked in impossible positions.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Baptism of the Selenites.jpg": "This painting certainly contains details of great richness of colour, such as the group of musicians playing in honour of their King, who is receiving the sacrament of baptism from St George.",
    "images/ADEMOLLO, Luigi/Fresco decoration (detail) (2).jpg": "The interior has a suite of rooms on the 'piano Mobile' which rejoices in the frescoes of Luigi Ademollo: they breathe the grace and Olympian calm of the Greek and Roman myths, The Marriage of Alexander and Roxana, and The Sacrifices of Numa. In contrast with these is the 'forest room' where a decoration of buildings and scenes of nature merges into endless greenery, creating illusory scenic prospects that rise to the changing sky of the ceiling and are lost in the dream-like images of the garden outside. The picture shows a detail of the decoration of the rooms on the piano nobile of the palazzo, entirely frescoed by Ademollo with mythological subjects, including griffins and garlands of flowers, and some 'woodland' decoration from a series of trompe-l'oeil landscapes.",
    "images/GHERARDI, Filippo/Oval ceiling panel (1).jpg": "The picture shows an oval ceiling panel in the west end section of the vault of the Grande Galleria in the Palazzo Colonna. It depicts the Allegorical Triumph of the Hero.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Sacrifice of Melchizedek.jpg": "The Priest-King of Salem brings Abraham bread and wine on the evening following the Battle of the Kings, and blesses him. Abraham, who kneels before him in armor, and the army to the right are a reminder of the battle which went before. To the left, we see the civilian population, including women, children and the elderly, while a triumphal procession is already approaching from behind the altar.",

    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Entombment.jpg": "A strictly symmetrical group is built up from the slab of stone that juts diagonally out of the background. His figures are bowed, bent, cowering, reclining or stooped. The self confident and the statuesque have been replaced by humility and subjection.",

    "images/JACOPO DI CIONE/San Pier Maggiore Altarpiece Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "The picture shows the central panel in the main tier of the large altarpiece made for the church of San Pier Maggiore, Florence. Christ crowns the Virgin, after her body and soul have been taken up to heaven. The event's glory and majesty are reflected here in the rich decoration of Christ and the Virgin's white robes, with golden embroidery showing birds, hearts and flowers. Angels, dressed in colourful robes, play beautifully detailed musical instruments, encouraging viewers to imagine heavenly music accompanying the scene.",
    "images/GÉRICAULT, Théodore/The Wounded Officer of the Imperial Guard Leaving the Battlefield.jpg": "The wounded officer, who can still clutch the reins of his rearing horse, is casting his eyes upwards to the dark, clouded sky. This was interpreted as the symbol of France in defeat, vainly trying to summon up the strength for a heroic stand.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/St Lawrence Enthroned with Saints and Donors (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the kneeling sons of the donor Alessandro Alessandri.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Resurrection of Christ (1).jpg": "This composition centres on the arisen Christ. He is the invincible testimony of faith haloed by the divine dazzling light which blazes from the open tomb. The four angels with large beating wings who have just removed the heavy marble slab from the tomb, are sort of inlaid into the supernatural light. At the same time two devout women come forward talking from the left deprived of natural light.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Madonna dei Palafrenieri.jpg": "Under the watchful gaze of St Anne, Jesus's apocryphal grandmother, Mary helps a naked Christ Child to tread on a snake. The snake may be interpreted as Satan and indirectly as heresy, for Mary and Jesus are free of sin and its consequences, Mary as a virgin mother and by reason of her Immaculate Conception, Jesus as God made man - and they combine to crush the serpent under their feet. Though their haloes are aligned, a dark gulf separates the pretty Mary from her ugly mother; and if the palafrenieri were willing to let Cardinal Scipione Borghese buy the picture so soon after they had received it and paid for it, it may have been because they disliked the unflattering depiction of their patroness.",

    "images/MASTER of Female Half-lengths/Mary Magdalene Holding the Unguent Jar.jpg": "Here the figure lifts the lid of an unguent jar that identifies her as Mary Magdalene, the most prominent of Christ's female followers. Her magnificent, richly ornamented clothing and headdress are typical of sixteenth-century courtly dress.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Madonna and Child (The Tempi Madonna).jpg": "The Virgin is holding the Christ Child closely and tenderly. She has eyes only for him, but the Child is looking at the observer, and so draws us into the intimate scene. The rapidly applied colour on the veil, where the paint has been modelled by brush strokes while still wet, shows Raphael using his materials much more freely than in his earlier panel paintings. The two figures are conceived as a single group, and this fact dominates the scene's visual impact. The only natural elements are a small strip of landscape and the light blue sky in the background. The Madonna's swollen mantle is meant to indicate movement.",
    "images/BIAGIO D'ANTONIO/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The unidentified sitter - no more than fifteen or sixteen years old - stands before an extensive landscape and stares at the spectator with self-confidence. The view of the walled city of Florence in the middle ground at left indicates that he was Florentine.",

    "images/LONGHI, Pietro/Duck Hunters on the Lagoon.jpg": "The canvas is very concentrated and intense in the way it shows the nobleman's sport. In the prow of a boat rowed by four rugged oarsmen, the powdered gentleman bends his bow to shoot terracotta pellets contained in the basket at his feet (a suitably quiet form of shooting for the Lagoon).",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ignudo (17).jpg": "The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper left corner of the Separation of Light from Darkness (above the prophet Jeremiah). Thus, the one above Jeremiah at the left, with a classical profile and a meditative attitude, contrasts sharply with the ungainly movement of the one the right, who laden with foliage and acorns, is throwing himself forward, his face in the shadow. On the opposite side, the two figures bend toward the centre, but with their torsos heads rotating in opposite directions with clearly distinct movements, splendidly rendered thanks to the artist's skilled use of perspective.",

Here, in the Rotterdam painting, an almost invisible church procession is ascending the ramps: Bruegel is criticizing the Catholic Church.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO/Last Supper and Stories of Christ's Passion.jpg": "The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged \"the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting\" (Berti).",
    "images/BECCAFUMI, Domenico/View of one of the long sides of the vault.jpg": "The picture shows one of the long sides of the vault with the following depictions: The Oath of Attilius Regulus (left) and Judgment of Zaleukos (right) in the two octagons, Prometheus Forms Man (left), Three Graces (centre), and Judgment of Paris (right) in the three oculi.

    "images/FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI/Madonna del Terremoto.jpg": "His beautiful little Biccherna cover, painted in his late twenties, draws effortlessly on an accumulated imagery of the city that goes back to the early trecento (as does the Biccherna form itself). Towers and palaces rise up, surmounted by the striped Cathedral and the tower of the Palazzo Pubblico, all contained within the circuit of the wall, its brick transformed to a hotter pink, as though lit by a setting sun. Shaken by earthquakes, the inhabitants have moved outside into a tented camp.",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Scenes from the Life of St John the Baptist 3. Feast of Herod.jpg": "The banquet takes place in a splendid open hall, decorated with small marble figures. John the Baptist is beheaded at the request of the dancing Salome. In contrast to the festiveness of the scene, Giotto increases the brutality of the events through the gestures, culminating in the encounter between Herod and the henchman, who hands him the severed head as if it were a dish of fare. Even although the surface of the faces is badly damaged, this moment of horror and outrage is still clear: plates, hands, dishes and head form an alarmingly brutal unity, over which soldier and king look at one another.",

    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Paradise and Hell.jpg": "These two pictures show two wings from one of Bosch's triptychs Philip bought and which is therefore still in Spain. On the left we watch evil invading the world. The creation of Eve is followed by the temptation of Adam and both are driven out of Paradise, while high above in the sky we see the fall of the rebellious angels, who are hurled from heaven as a swarm of repulsive insects. On the other wing we are shown a vision of hell. There we see horror piled upon horror, fires and torments and all manner of fearful demons, half animal, half human or half machine, who plague and punish the poor sinful souls for all eternity.",

The second saint kneeling before the Cross is harder to identify, his black habit would suggest an Augustinian saint.",

    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Feast in the House of Simon (detail) (2).jpg": "Pediments, colonnaded halls and roof terraces filled with onlookers are a notable feature of Veronese's great feast scenes. The bearded oriental who points to the scene of Christ being anointed ensures the multiple interweaving and dovetailing of pictorial architecture and figurative staffage so typical of Veronese.",

    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Lute Player.jpg": "The lutanist, with parted lips, sings of love from the madrigal Voi sapete ch ['io v'amo] (you know that [I love you]) by the Flemish composer Arcadelt. In front of him are a violin and bow which invite the spectator to take part in a duet with him; the fruit and the vegetables, and indeed the music itself, imply the harmony that should exist between lovers. The glass carafe and its flowers are painted with assured mastery, and Caravaggio is also aware of the problems of perspective that lutes and violins could cause; and he spotlights the the solo player and his instruments so as to make them the main focus of attention, the carafe of flowers so that they are a secondary focus.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/Portrait of the Dwarf Morgante (front).jpg": "The canvas portrays the dwarf as a \"fowler\", or bird-catcher, as he was not allowed to hunt larger animals, this being an activity reserved for characters of higher ranks. The character is portrayed respectively from the front and back at two subequent moments of the action: at the front we see him before the hunt, holding an owl in a snare to be used as a bait to capture a jay that is flying in the air. Two scarce swallowtail butterflies cover his genitals. From behind, we see him just about to turn towards the viewer, eager to proudly show off his prey.",
    "images/CAMPI, Vincenzo/The Ascension of Christ.jpg": "The picture shows the decoration of the vault of the cloister church San Paolo Converso in Milan. The long hall of the church is divided by a wall into an area for the laity in front and one for the nuns in the back. In each case the vault is united into a single large illusionistic architectural structure that opens through a shaft in the centre onto the heavens and the apotheosis of Christ or of Mary. Along the spring line of the vault there is a series of painted arches, offering places for the apostles as witnesses. The actual, simple room of the church in which viewers stand is enriched and made more splendid by this fictive architecture and is connected to the world in heaven by these illusionistic stages. The church is transformed into a holy site of divine epiphany thanks to the compelling power of the optical illusion. The centring the whole room on a single, dominant vision of heaven had countless successors in Baroque ceiling decoration.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Vision of the Cross (detail).jpg": "The view of the \"Tomb-pyramid of Romulus\", which is no longer there, and the so-called Citadel of Sant'Angelo together with the bridge of Sant'Angelo, is an example of Raphael's interest in ancient Rome.",
    "images/ANTONIO DA NEGROPONTE/Madonna and Child Enthroned.jpg": "With a refined naturalistic taste, the painter painstakingly depicted the espalier of roses in the background and the many kind of birds in the foreground. The throne of the Virgin is a complicated structure, with classical details absorbed into a fantastic and eclectic whole.",
    "images/MASTER M S/The Resurrection (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the soldier holding a bow at the left side of the painting.",

    "images/PINTURICCHIO/View of the Piccolomini Library (2).jpg": "The picture shows the view from the window wall of the entry wall with the scenes of the presentation of Frederick III to Eleonora of Portugal and Enea Silvio Piccolomini being elevated to cardinal. The ten compartments are separated by painted pilasters with grotteschi decoration, while each individual scene is framed by illusionistic jambs and arches decorated with simulated red and white marble paneling. Wee seem to be looking through the arches of a gigantic loggia into scenes from Enea Silvio's life. The pageant-like incidents display a panoply of colourful costumes against fanciful architectural or landscape backgrounds, except when a recognizable setting was required by the narrative.",
    "images/TIBALDI, Pellegrino/View of the ceiling vault.jpg": "From the entry corridor of the palace one walks first into a large hall (Sala di Ulisse), where the cycle begins. One finds the continuation and conclusion in a smaller room directly adjoining the hall (Stanza di Ulisse). Between the fields of the painted histories, illusionistic views open onto colonnades that seem to reach up to the heaven.",
    "images/MELLIN, Charles/The Tuscan General Alessandro del Borro ().jpg": "This amusing Baroque painting represents a buffoonlike military figure, genially displaying his corpulence in fullest profile, a Barberini banner at his feet.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DA MILANO/Three pinnacle panels.jpg": "The three panels representing the Virgin, the Apocalyptic Christ (Son of Man), and St John the Baptist, come from a single altarpiece painted for an unknown location. Above each figure is a seraph in a quatrefoil.",
    "images/ROUSSEAU, Henri/War.jpg": "The picture evokes however a horribly ghostly and nightmarish atmosphere.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Christ Carrying the Cross.jpg": "Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of Mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them. Standing on a small hill in the foreground, the grieving friends of Christ are separated from the teeming detail of this scene, with Christ carrying the cross at its centre, and are thus brought closer to the viewer. St John and the saint on the right (and the two mourners a little further back) originated in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), which Bruegel can have known only from copies, since the painting itself had been taken to Spain around the middle of the 16th century. In the background, we can make out a Flemish Jerusalem on the left and the hill of Calvary on the right, with a rock and windmill of unknown significance between them.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Madonna dell'Impannata.jpg": "It shows St Catherine, St Elizabeth, Christ, the Virgin and St John gathered together in a group. A large tent is visible in the background and a window covered by linen (the impannata, or cloth covering of a window, which gives the painting its name) can be seen at the extreme right.",
    "images/DADDI, Bernardo/Polyptych of San Pancrazio Predella panel.jpg": "Of these it is Joseph's rod that flowers and onto which the Holy Spirit descends, thus indicating that he has been chosen to marry the Virgin. In Daddi's panel the dove can be seen perched on the top of Joseph's rod while the disappointed suitors break their rods over their knees as the marriage takes place.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Goswijn van der/Triptych of Abbot Antonius Tsgrooten.jpg": "He is shown kneeling on the right-hand panel, in the presence of the Virgin Mary. The central panel depicts Christ as intermediary and Man of Sorrows, surrounded by the instruments of his Passion.",
    "images/CIMA da Conegliano/St Peter Martyr with St Nicholas of Bari, St Benedict and an Angel Musician.jpg": "The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour. The traveling artist has evoked memories of his birthplace, setting it on the shores of a quiet lake and peopling it with shepherds, as in an Arcadian dream.",
    "images/BARNABA DA MODENA/Altarpiece.jpg": "It consists of four scenes and a predella. The scenes, arranged thematically in vertical pairs, depict The Coronation of the Virgin, The Trinity, The Virgin and Child with Donors, and The Crucifixion. The predella, divided into two parts, shows the twelve Apostles, not individually distinguished.",
    "images/TURCHI, Alessandro/David with the Head of Goliath.jpg": "The figure of David is shown against a dark background with no accoutrements other than the sling hanging from his left hand.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Madonna of the Meadow (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the landscape in the right part of the painting.",
    "images/VALESIO, Giovanni Luigi/Ceiling painting.jpg": "The Casino is decorated by paintings on the ground floor and the second floor. It simulates an opening above a balustrade depicted in perspective. Behind it gambol crowds of putti with intertwining bands whose isolated letters produce Cardinal Ludovisi's name and title. The background is painted in a deep rich shade of blue. The ceiling is a visual feast of rich colours, movement and joy.",
    "images/MALOUEL, Jean/Virgin and Child.jpg": "The half length figure of the Virgin, with the Child supported by her right arm, is shown within the three-dimensional representation of a window-frame. The motif of the window-frame provides the reason why the Virgin is represented as a half length figure. The Child's delicate body is also depicted from the waist upwards, emerging from Mary's wide and velvety soft cloak. (See, for example, the protruding form at the Madonna's right shoulder.) The arrangement whereby the folds of the mantle spread out radially from the Madonna's left wrist is most refined and so is the narrowing down of the blue area of the whole drapery at the bottom part of the picture. The two figures are almost fused together by love, and yet are surrounded by a melancholy mood, the austere premonition of the Passion. The Virgin is absorbed in her thoughts, the Child opens His big, round eyes and looks at the spectator. His forefinger may enjoin silence upon the approaching worshipper.",

    "images/ZIMMERMANN, Johann Baptist/The Nymph, as Symbol of Nymphenburg.jpg": "In the main view, the beautiful nymph appears in a charming Arcadian setting. She is enthroned on the steps of a garden architecture flanked on the right by an overgrown arched pergola and on the left by a fountain with a rocaille ornament. The picture shows a detail of the ceiling fresco in the Steinerner Saal of Schloss Nymphenburg in Munich.",
    "images/LA TOUR, Georges de/The Dream of St Joseph.jpg": "A youth in biblical costume is making a beckoning or announcing gesture before an old man who has fallen asleep reading a book. The youth is hardly the angel Gabriel either, coming to warn Joseph to flee to Egypt in order to escape the impending massacre of all children in Bethlehem by Herod's soldiers. A possible explanation for this enigmatic picture is that it depicts the moment when the young Samuel, having been, he thinks, summoned by the elderly priest Eli, finds him asleep. This surprises Samuel, who at that instant realizes that it is God's voice calling him. If this interpretation of the subject is correct, La Tour has with characteristic subtlety and understatement shown the exact moment when the youth Samuel arrives before the sleeping old man, with a 'here I am' gesture.",

    "images/NORDSTRÖM, Karl Fredrik/A Clearing in the Woods at Grèz.jpg": "The female figure near the point where the path vanishes may seem to have been positioned by chance, but in fact she has her specific spatial and narrative part to play in the overall composition.",

    "images/VAROTARI, Dario the Elder/Scene from the Story of Jacob.jpg": "It shows Jacob telling Rachel and Leah that he wishes to leave Laban's service. Jacob urges Rachel and Leah to leave with him. Out by the well, he encounters Laban's younger daughter Rachel tending her father's sheep, and decides to marry her.

    "images/DOMENICO VENEZIANO/The Madonna and Child with Saints (detail).jpg": "The detail shows St Francis and St John the Baptist. St John the Baptist is extremely muscular, with powerful limbs and thick extremities; he looks out  of the oainted space at the spectator, who is, in turn, drawn by John's gesture toward the enthroned Madonna. Mary and the Child turn back toward John, who is presented in full face.",
    "images/GUERCINO/Magdalen and Two Angels.jpg": "The artist depicted the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the angels in front of Christ's empty sepulcher as narrated in the Gospel of John (20:11-15). Guercino emphasizes the clasped hands of the kneeling saint, whose face is contorted in sorrow as she leans against the closed tomb - empty now that Christ has risen. The Magdalen's gaze is directed towards the large nail held by an angel at the right.",
    "images/MUNKÁCSY, Mihály/Churning Woman.jpg": "The countryside reminded the artist of this strugglesome childhood and years of apprenticeship, the humiliations he had to suffer and the poverty. the whites are shining brightly; the tired face of the woman, her rugged hands and humble dress, and the simple commodities of her surrounding represent the hard work and her arduous life.",
    "images/GÉRARD, François/Corinne at Cape Miseno (1).jpg": "The present version depicts Corinne the moment after she relates the stories of the famous Cape Miseno in the Bay of Naples, shown here in the background. In a moment of great nostalgia and sadness, the poetess, dressed as a muse a l'antique, sits on a ruined column, her eyes averted to the sky.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/8. Battle between Heraclius and Chosroes.jpg": "The Eastern Emperor Heraclius wages war on the Persian King and, having defeated him, returns to Jerusalem with the Holy Wood. Piero includes no landscape, concentrating instead on the battle. The motif of the horse rearing over a fallen enemy is common in Roman sculpture. In representing the episode Piero has chosen to represent the grim mechanics of the slaughter: there are no beautiful patterns, no lovely light, and the armour has little allure. The legs of horses and people fill the lower part of the composition, while above masses of steel and flesh collide. There are incidents of utter brutality, as when a soldier near the throne jabs his dagger into the throat of another, or of pathos, as we watch the dying figure below the rearing horse. The dethroned monarch on the far right awaits the executioner's sword. Above him the True Cross is blasphemously incorporated into his throne.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Loggia of Psyche (1).jpg": "The frescoes represent the Story of Psyche, a myth derived from the Golden Ass of Apuleius (2nd century A. D.). Treating the room as a pergola, he designed the two large ceiling pictures that simulate tapestries stretched across the roof. These huge awnings were painted so ingeniously that we can see the straps holding them in place and the scalloped edges they create by stretching the material. The cycle of pictures appears only on the ceiling. Raphael designed a view out onto a brilliant blue sky, in which half-naked figures - either hovering or standing on clouds - merge into an erotically charged scene. The simulated tapestries depict two scenes: the gods deciding to subject Psyche to various tests, and Psyche holding a magnificent banquet to celebrate her acceptance into the circle of the Immortals.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece The Killing of Abel.jpg": "The scene at top of the niche containing the figure of Eve depicts in grisaille the Killing of Abel.",

    "images/PERINO DEL VAGA/General view.jpg": "The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with \"living\" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings. The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room.",

    "images/DYCK, Sir Anthony van/Lamentation over the Dead Christ.jpg": "He achieves a dramatic effect by shedding light on the face of the Virgin Mary and leaving that of Jesus in semi-darkness, although the latter's nude body, skillfully rendered and barely covered by the white shroud, seems to be the source of light. In this case the painter, who produced several versions of this theme, resorts to a landscape composition in which the figures form two groups connected by the child angel who is crying inconsolably: on the one hand, Magdalene, Jesus Christ and Mary, and on the other, two adult angels. The end figures lean towards the centre, thereby closing the composition.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Presentation at the Temple.jpg": "The two paintings, now housed respectively at the Galleria Querini Stampalia in Venice and the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, have an identical structure and the same characters: in the foreground, leaning against a marble ledge, the Virgin is holding the swaddled Child while the old priest stretches out to take it. At sides and in the centre are several characters identified as Jacopo Bellini (the old man in the middle) and as Nicolosia and Andrea Mantegna, possibly recently married (the young couple standing at the sides facing left).",

The absolute immobility of the enigmatic figure depicted frontally provides a triking contrast to the activity of the woman in the opposite spandrel. Placed precisely on the axis of the triangle, she appears to be deep in meditation and totally extraneous to the two figures - a man and a child - that may be discerned behind her in the darkness. In accordance with the lunette below, it can be assumed that Jesse as a child is depicted here together with his parents. The bronze nudes, with their backs turned toward the viewer, seem to be looking upward, like those above the opposit spandrel.",

    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Scenes from the Passion of Christ (left side).jpg": "Entry into Jerusalem (left side)  Having taken leave of his mother (she stands on the far left with Mary Magdalene), Christ rides a donkey towards the gate of the city, followed on foot by the Apostles. The people cut off palm branches and take off their cloaks, which they spread out on the ground. A man, his knees half-bent, doffs his cap. Christ Drives the Money-Lenders from the Temple (left side)  3. Judas with the High Priests (left side) This scene takes place diagonally below the previous one in a chapel-like space lit by torches. Judas is seen amongst the Pharisees who have given him a purse of money in return for his betrayal of Christ. Last Supper (left side) The moment depicted is that where John, his head on his master's chest, asks the name of the traitor, to which Christ responds by placing a piece of bread in Judas' mouth, whereupon Judas leaves. Prayer in the Garden (left side)  6. Arrest of Christ (left side) Judas kisses Christ to identify him to the soldiers and Peter cuts off Malchus' ear. The action takes place in the dark. The soldiers emerge with torches from an archway lower down. A peacock sits on the city wall. The symbolism of this bird probably does not relate to the scene to its left but to the overall iconography of the Redemption and Rebirth. Peter can be made out in a small side building, together with a glimpse of Caiaphas' maid, who has recognised him. The cock is shown above between the statues of Adam and Eve, who function as symbols of human weakness. Christ before Pilate (middle)  Pilate, seated on his throne and assisted by two high officials, interrogates Christ. The man on the left will accompany him to Golgotha. The figure on the right is the one who paid Judas in the earlier scene. Pilate's wife touches his shoulder and urges him to be cautious. A young servant holds the basin of water in which Pilate will later wash his hands. A sculpted portrayal of the Judgment of Solomon appears above as a contrast to the cowardly jjudgment of Pilate. Flagellation (middle)  On either side of the arched opening stand white stone sculptures of bearded, naked men, one with a jawbone in his hand, the other with a bow and arrow. The arch itself is decorated with a vine motif between two snails. This scene takes place to the right of the Ecce Homo in a narrow little building set further back. It is clearly intended to depict Christ (with an aureole) appearing before Pilate. Ecce Homo (middle)  Herod, with his wife behind him in the shadows, shows Christ to the people who, by their gestures, condemn him to crucifixion. As Christ's torture proceeds, two joiners construct the Cross. Their tools comprise a long hatchet, a large and a small drill and a wooden hammer. Carrying of the Cross (right side) A long procession departs from the city gate. John, Mary and two Holy Women follow Christ, who falls to his knees and looks at the viewer. He is preceded by the two thieves. A dog sniffs around to the lower left. Amongst those present we recognise Pilate and his acolyte. To the left of the Cross we see the blind Longinus, whose sight is restored, and to the right the converted centurion. At the bottom of the scene Herod and his companion ride back down the mountain. Below them and to the left we see a monkey, a symbol of the devil, which Memling used repeatedly. Christ Appearing by the Sea of Galilee (right side)",

The family group fits perfectly into the triangular field and appear, for once, closely linked by the interplay gestures and glances, focused on the woman's activity.

A few delicate red and yellow highlights are enough to enliven a composition largely dominated by subtly gradated browns and greys.",

    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/San Zeno Polyptych (2).jpg": "The altarpiece occupies a privileged position in the church, because the main altar area is raised above the level of the nave, and a special window was opened to increase the amount of light on the picture. At the base are three large, nearly square predella scenes. The stage upon which the holy gathering takes place is set against an \"open air\" background. The garlands suspended from the proscenium which appear to thread between the simulated columns of the painting and the actual wooden ones of the frame, dissolve the idea of the fourth wall of the traditional perspective box.",
    "images/STUBBS, George/Two Bay Hunters in a Paddock.jpg": "The tranquil and serenely bucolic setting – a paddock in spring, with clumps of burdock in the foreground, a low paling fence curving round to a thatched shelter and distant hills beyond – is equally typical of Stubbs's preferred setting for his portraits of horses in the latter part of his career: the mood reflective and calm, the emphasis being on the noble dignity of the animals themselves.",

At her feet are Time and Fortune, with the wheel of destiny and the enemies of peace lying humiliated on the ground. Above the head of Happiness is Fame sounding a trumpet, and Glory holding a laurel garland. This Happiness, with the cornucopia, is a triumph of pink and blue; the naked bodies of the figures are smooth, almost stroked by the colour as if they were precious stones - round and well-defined those of the young women, haggard and leaden that of the old man.",

Confectionery made of crystallized sugar, nuts, figs and raisins, some in a costly Chinese bowl and some outside it, represent spiritual principles which are being guarded, as it were, by the green-feathered parrot sitting on the far edge of the bowl.

One is Venus, with an apple (or an orange, which the infant Jesus also holds sometimes instead of an apple, and which represents desire, so that it has the same metaphorical value), symbol of love and beauty, given to her by Bacchus. But she also takes on the allegorical significance of Victory, who usually holds a pomegranate in her right hand and a helm in her left. By this she is, in turn, referring to Mars, disarmed by Cupid, winged boy and the son of Venus, seated on the armor. The victorious Venus rests on the stump of a tree. Behind stands a stag, symbol of nobility and courtesy and emblem of the royal house of France. Its antlers, resembling the branches of a tree, are periodically renewed, symbolizing the continual rebirth of life.",
    "images/ALTICHIERO da Zevio/St George Slays the Dragon.jpg": "It is characteristic of Altichiero that he did not limit the scene to the figures of the knight slaying the dragon with his lance and the princess; he added a rocky landscape that stretches deep into space at the left of the image and, as a counterpart to this on the right, included a fantastic image of the city of Silene from whose walls the king and his wife, as well as the inhabitants of the city, follow with frightened looks the battle taking place before the city gate.",
    "images/PUCCINELLI, Antonio/Portrait of the Noblewoman Marrocchi.jpg": "In this painting, the somber hues of the woman's dress and the dark green of the background are effectively set off against her white blouse and lace collar.

    "images/CARLEVARIS, Luca/The Reception of Cardinal César d'Estrées.jpg": "With the help of central perspective, the artist leads the eye of the spectator from the Ducal Palace, over the Molo to the Fonteghetto della Farina, where the entrance to the Grand Canal is marked by the silhouette of Santa Maria della Salute and the Punta della Dogana. Further to the left, behind a throng of gondolas and other boats, we can see the hazy profile of the Giudecca. Owing to the many figures in the foreground, the canvas seems to transcend the genre of the veduta. The schooner behind the gondolas in the left foreground has just fired a salute. A group of dignitaries crosses the Molo in the direction of the Ducal Palace, among them Procurators recognizable by their red robes. A curious crowd watches the procession; it includes many figures also found in Carlevaris's lively oil studies of daily life in the Serenissima. Furthermore the composition draws attention to the prelate in the midst of the crowd; since only one French ambassador to Venice held an ecclesiastical office - Cardinal d'Estrées - the reception must be his.",

In the irregular field of the pendentive on the left is the story opf On the right of the pendentive, the king sends Haman to provide royal apparel for Mordecai, who is sitting at the king's door. On the left Esther reveals Haman's plot to Ahasueras. The whole fresco is dramatically dominated, in the central scene, by the punishment of Haman. The daring foreshortening of the body, which literally cuts through the picture plane, is reinforced by by that of the white frame of the door leading into Ahasueras' room. Esther, an orphan, was 'fair and beautiful' and had been brought up by her cousin, Mordecai. Michelangelo's fresco depicts three episodes of the story in the centre with the crucifixion of Haman (instead of the Biblical hanging).",

In contrast to the other young woman, depicted with loose hair, this one - an eighteen-year-old, according to the inscription - wears her hair in large braids wrapped around her head, a sign that she opted for marriage. Similarly allude the sprigs of sea holly (Eryngium campestre) and Southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum), symbols of conjugal fidelity and eroticism, which she holds in her hand. Note that one of the portraits has a neutral background, while the other has a window with a landscape scene.

    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/St Anthony Preaching to the Fish.jpg": "In fact the artist has taken an original approach to the composition with the sweeping seascape that characterizes the entire scenes; the gulf on the left is balanced on the right by the figures of the saint and the bystanders, arranged on parallel planes and along a diagonal that indicates the depth of the space in which they move. The Franciscan saint, holding the traditional white lily, is represented standing on a tongue of land, preaching and pointing at the sea, where we can see the fish that have risen to the surface to hear his words. Anthony towers over the others; the pose, expressing the passion of his oratory, recalls that of many of Veronese's figures. His gesture, which serves to articulate the downward slope of the scene toward the edge, is echoed by the figures seen from the back, both the one in the middle, in a Manneristic attitude, and that of the Oriental in the foreground. The figures wearing turbans - as was customary in the art of Venice - render the sacred content of the representation \"ecumenical.\"",

It is situated in the upper row on the right side below the scene of the Entombment. The Deposition, with the same gold background as the Crucifixion (excluding any possibility of distraction), is represented as intense embracing. Joseph of Arimathaea and John support the lifeless body, while Nicodemus removes the nails from the feet and the Virgin reaches out yearningly to her son, looking into his closed eyes. One of the Marys holds Christ's arm to her face, while the others, their hands covered by their veils, are tragic masks of grief. The little stream of blood under the cross, also present in the previous scene, has a dramatic realism.",

The coats of arms, added shortly after and placed on the external side beside the portraits, were those of the same family, even though the coats of arms are different: one has a cross between two fish, the other an upside-down lily. For this reason, it was deduced that the young woman portrayed with loose hair, the coral bracelet, the hands joined in prayer, and her head bowed down had devoted herself to the cloistered life. It should be noted that the young woman with the loose hair also rests her arms on a window sill.",

    "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/St Florian Taking Leave of the Monastery.jpg": "Particularly noteworthy is the crystalline clearness of the colours, especially the whites, which contribute to giving the story and the whole scene a somewhat unreal atmosphere.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ignudo (10).jpg": "The picture shows the Ignudo at the lower right corner of the Creation of Eve (above the Cumaean Sibyl). In the four ignudi of the fifth bay who hold the yellow ribbons interwoven with the bronze-coloured medallions, the use of contrapposta with a variety of gestures and poses has now been replaced the symmetrical arrangement of figures. The relationship between the figures, placed opposite each other in pairs, is based on increasingly free and complex rhythmical correspondences, with rotating movements and pronounced bendings of the limbs.",
    "images/HIGHMORE, Joseph/Portrait of Thomas Fermor.jpg": "He is portrayed half length, standing wearing a blue velvet coat and a sash of the Order of the Bath, pointing with his left hand to two classical busts standing amongst boscage, his coronet on the table to the left.",

    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Portrait of Antony of Burgundy.jpg": "This symbolises the personal bond with Philip the Good, the head and founder of the order of knighthood. Flints, steel and sparks, the emblems of Philip the Good, form the links in the chain. Court dignitaries, knights, tournament judges and soldiers are frequently depicted with an arrow, as a symbol of office, a token of special distinction or merit, or as an attribute. His hairstyle and the high, conical hat point to the period shortly after 1460. The face is individualised, but the traits reflect a pattern of softly-flowing curves.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Slaughter of the Innocents.jpg": "The Slaughter of the Innocents is on the third level of the left wall of the chapel, next to the Adoration of the Magi. It was not without reason that he placed a Roman triumphal arch covered with relief of classical battle scenes towering up behind the dramatic events. Once again the background of the picture acts as a backdrop, for the figures are bunched together on a densely packed front stage and are not integrated into architecture. The Slaughter of the Innocents takes place amid a violent swirl of movements and gestures. There is a dramatic confusion of people's and horses' bodies, which fall upon each other all around. Ghirlandaio depicts the classical model for the scene at the top on the arch. The mothers of Bethlehem are in a wild panic, trying to save their children from the killers' swords, which are flashing through the air. On the ground lie the mutilated bodies of the slaughtered innocents in pools of blood. In the foreground on the right a desperately screaming mother, her red garment billowing in frantic folds, is tearing at the hair of one of the killers from behind. Pure horror is written on her face. The soldier, dressed in classical armor that has a blue leather body piece shaped to indicated the ribs, is bending right over backwards. The foreground of the picture is characterized by falling horses, bloody limbs and heads, streaming hair and drawn swords. On the far right the fleeing mothers are bunched together, but they will not succeed in escaping Herod's order that all the children of the same age as Christ should be put to the sword.",

Four angels sound trumpets at the feet of Christ; they announce the Last Judgment and waken the dead. They surround the Archangel Michael, who, resplendent in his white robe scarlet cloak, impassively weighs the resurrected. The scale on his left sinks under the weight of the sins of one of the damned screaming  in terror while in the other, one of the chosen seems to be expressing his thanks to the Archangel. One cannot fail to admire the delicate brushwork and colouring of the brooch holding the Archangel's cloak.",

The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right. It shows the naked Christ bound to a column alluding to the praetorium (judgment hall) of Pontius Pilate where Christ was condemned to death.",
    "images/CHARONTON, Enguerrand/Pietà de Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.jpg": "The figures, which might have been taken from Gothic sculpture, are placed before a chased golden background. To the left of the middle distance is the view of a small town with spires, to the right austere mountains. The suffering figure of the Virgin dominates the painting. No longer young, her pallid face is immobile in its grief. Her blue mantle covers her head, revealing a white veil, and spreads out in huge folds to her feet. In a strange pose, the back arched, the body rigid, Christ, a white cloth wrapped across his loins, appears to be floating on her lap. A young St John bends in loving tenderness above him, with the kneeling donor beside St John. On the right the mourning, pitiful figure of St Mary Magdalen completes the diagonal line arching over the Virgin and St John to the donor. The yellow-lined red cloak of the Magdalen extends around her in a great curve. Her left hand holds the vase of ointment, with the right she presses the edge of her cloak to her eye."
