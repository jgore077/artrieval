The bride dressed in white sitting beside Cupid is assisted by Venus in person. The figure with the vase of jewels symbolizes `fleeting happiness on earth' and the one bearing the burning flame of God's love symbolizes `eternal happiness in heaven'. The title is the result of a late 18th-century interpretation of the painting, which gives a moralistic reading of the nude figure, whereas the artist intended this to be an exaltation of both earthly and heavenly love. In fact in the Neoplatonic philosophy that Titian and his circle believed in contemplating the beauty of the creation led to an awareness of the divine perfection of the order of the cosmos. In this painting of love in the open countryside Titian has surpassed the delicate lyrical poetry of Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione and attributes a classical grandeur to his figures. In 1899, the Rothschilds offered to buy this world famous work at a price that was higher than the estimated value of the Villa Borghese and all its works of art (4,000,000 Lire as opposed to 3,600,000 Lire) . However, Titian's Sacred and Profane Love has remained and virtually become the symbol of the Borghese Gallery itself.",

The open Bible on the table indicates the source of the family's strength in the soldier's absence.

Købke usually painted small-scale pictures of great precision - landscapes, studies of architectural subjects and portraits of his family and friends. Whatever the subject, he invariably combined carefully observed, often richly coloured naturalistic details, with a sense of controlled abstract design. This painting was made in about 1830, when he was developing his mature style, and shows the bakery in the Kastel, which is a castle in Copenhagen that served as a prison. The three figures in the foreground are Købke's father, who owned the bakery, Major J.J. Krohn, and the slave Sergeant Sporch (the prisoners were described as 'slaves'). The scene was one with which Købke was very familiar as he lived within the castle compound from 1817 to 1834. In the later 1830s his family moved out of Copenhagen and he concentrated on depicting more rural scenes; subsequent visits to Germany and Italy broadened the scope of his subject matter still further.",

        "description": "The success of the Legend of St Hubert mural won Denis the admiration of Ivan Morozov (1871-1921), who in 1907 commissioned him to create a spectacular private decorative mural. As one of the most famous art collectors in Russia, Morozov's sphere of interest encompassed French art, which included works by Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. Securing a major commission from such a collector was an important marker in Denis's career. He created ten panels entitled The Story of Psyche, for the music room of Morozov's mansion in Moscow. The monumental canvases depicting episodes in the adventures of Eros, the god of love, and his beloved, the mortal maiden Psyche, a tale from the novel Metamorphoses written in the second century by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis (c. 124-170). In these canvases Denis moves away from his earlier Nabi icons, instead of using Greek mythology to tell his story of Christian humanity. First presented in Paris in 1909, before being installed in Moscow, the complete work today is part of the collection at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. This series of canvases show the work of a mature artist in his development of style, imagery and colour harmony across all canvases. The photo shows a reconstruction of the music room interior of the mansion of Ivan Morozov in the Hermitage Museum.",

        "description": "From the mid-1450s through the mid-1460s, Filippo Lippi evolved a new presentation of the Virgin and Child that became popular in the second half of the Quattrocento in Florence. The composition and iconography were grounded in two traditions: St Bridget of Sweden's account of her vision of the Virgin adoring the Christ Child lying upon the ground, and early Renaissance Tuscan depictions of the Nativity. Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion. Fra Filippo's first version of this type was ostensibly a Nativity, made for the Benedictine Annalena nunnery around 1455. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\" hover above. Lippi's subsequent elaborations of this type, however, omit these narrative markers: the triptych for Alfonso of Naples, whose lost central panel is known only through a rapid sketch by Fra Filippo and the surviving wings representing Sts Anthony Abbot and Michael, the altarpiece for the chapel in the Palazzo Medici, and a painting said to have come from a cell in the Camaldoli hermitage, dedicated to the Baptist and patronized by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici and his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, built in 1463. These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light. This painting was commissioned in about 1463 by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, the wife of Piero de' Medici, for the hermitage of Camaldoli. The represented saints are the Young St John the Baptist and St Romuald.",

        "type": "portrait",
        "description": "More so even than Giorgione and Titian, it is Lorenzo Lotto who should be considered the true inventor of the Renaissance psychological portrait. Lorenzo Lotto was born in Venice. Though he spent many years in Bergamo, and probably entered Alvise Vivarini's studio there, for much of his life he was restless, continually moving from town to town. In their haste to identify the artist's subjects with his way of life, many early historians of art found in his work traces of the instability and restlessness ascribed to Lotto in sixteenth-century accounts of his life. This has meant that Lotto, to whom the authorship of only a small number of paintings can be attributed beyond doubt, has come to be seen as the painter of a considerable number of idiosyncratic works whose authorship cannot finally be determined. The heterogeneous style and subject-matter of Lotto's oeuvre thus seems to confirm the conflicting nature of his personality. Reference to the \"psychological\" portrait here should not be understood in the modern sense of the epithet. The visual medium chosen by Lotto to portray mental states was less one of analytical disclosure than its opposite: enigma. His tendency to present the spectator with riddles was intensified by his mysterious symbolism, and by his frequent emblematical or hieroglyphic allusiveness. Although Lotto's allusions, in their literal sense, could be fathomed perhaps only by the \"cognoscente\" of his day, they are nevertheless capable of inspiring a wealth of vivid associative detail. This can be a source of fascination, as well as of frustration, to the the spectator who has little access to their original meaning. Lotto's early portrait of a young man wearing a round black beret and buttoned, black coat still owes much to the traditional aesthetic of imitation. Scholars have rightly pointed to the influence of Giovanni Bellini here. The physiognomy of his powerful nose and searching grey-brown eyes, which, under the slightly knitted brow, seem to brood on the spectator, to view him almost with suspicion, is so faithful a rendering of empirical detail that we are reminded of another painter, one whose brushwork was learned from the Netherlandish masters: Antonello da Messina. What is new here is the element of disquiet that has entered the composition along with the waves and folds of the white damask curtain. A breeze appears to have blown the curtain aside, and in the darkness, through a tiny wedge-shaped crack along the right edge of the painting, we see the barely noticeable flame of an oil-lamp. Curtains are an important iconographical feature in Lotto's work. The motif is adopted from devotional painting, where it often provided a majestically symbolic backdrop for saints or other biblical figures. Since early Christian times, the curtain had been seen as a \"velum\", whose function was either to veil whatever was behind it, or, by an act of \"re-velatio\", or pulling aside of the curtain, to reveal it. To judge from the curtain which fills most of Lotto's canvas, we may safely conclude that he intends to reveal very little indeed of the \"true nature\" of his sitter. What he finally does reveal is done with such reserve and discretion as to be barely insinuated. For the burning lamp is undoubtedly an emblem of some kind. It may, in fact, be an allusion to the passage in St. John: \"lux in tenebris\" ('And the light shineth in darkness', Joh. 1, 5). It is interesting to note that Isabella d'Este chose to cite this light/darkness metaphor in her own \"impresa\" in 1525, altering the original to refer to her isolation at the Mantuan court: \"sufficit unum (lumen) in tenebris\" (a single light suffices in the darkness). Perhaps Lotto intended to convey a similar message through his portrait of this young man. Although the date of this portrait is disputed, stylistic and morphological similarities to figures in the Recanati polyptych of 1508 have induced some critics to assign it that approximate date. Others have compared it to Raphael's early portraits and dated it somewhat later.",

It became very popular in many versions produced by other artists at the end of Gossart's life and thereafter. These variants differ in size, shape, background design - whether interior or landscape - and in the poses of the figures. By far the most popular of these variants was a version in which the legs of the Christ Child are crossed. The present nonautograph example of this version was signed IOANNES MALBODIVS PINGEBAT and originally dated 1531. Although Gossart may have produced such a variant late in his lifetime, it is equally possible that the signature and date refer to Gossart's fame and a modification of his design that was in mass production about that date in Antwerp.",

In the niche behind the altar table is the tomb of the donor, Filippo Strozzi, above it on the altar wall, an allegorical pictorial program referring to the donor. In the stained-glass window a Madonna and Child and Philip and John as the chapel's patron saints are represented, in the vaulting compartment Adam and the serpent are depicted. The painting on the window wall is nothing at all like the sort of decor that was customary in family chapels. Lacking the bright colours of the stained-glass window and the pilasters on either side, these paintings recede into the background, and the contrast between their monochrome tones and the vivid stories on the side walls makes sit obvious that this pictorial program relates to the iconography of the tombs. Only selected motifs - the angels, for example, and some of the ornamental details - are painted in colour, and these stand out dramatically against the painted architecture. The painted columns on either side of the pointed-arched window stand atop high pedestals that flank the round arch above the tomb. The spandrels above that arch are filled with puzzling paintings in grisaille: in each one a winged youth stands with one foot on a skull and holds out another skull in his hand. Although it is impossible to know exactly what these mean, there is no doubt that they have to do with the presence of the donor's tomb directly below them. The theological virtues Fides and Caritas adorn the pedestals beneath the projecting columns on either side of the window. On the left, two putti playing instruments accompany a seated female figure identified by an inscription as Parthenice. There is a pair of women with masks of tragedy and comedy next to the right pilaster and above the inscription DEO MAX. They can be identified as Muses.",

The composition is not the product of a single, specific visual impression, however, but is highly artificial, being composed of no less than six individual studies which Friedrich executed between 1806 and 1810. The landscape-format composition presents a plain extending without interruption into the background, seen as if the viewer were standing on the gentle rise which begins in the bottom left and right-hand corners. From here, our gaze falls upon a small pond - to which no path leads - and upon a huge oak tree, which looks at first sight to be fairly close by. Once our eyes have also registered the diminutive figure of a shepherd leaning against its trunk, however, the tree suddenly appears further away and hence gigantic. Aspects of proximity and distance are permanently chafing against each other throughout the painting, whereby rational everyday experience is thwarted by visual irrationality. While an idyll of unspoilt nature unfolds around the oak and the shepherd, the villages and church spires of the land developed by man are as it were concealed and compressed within a valley by the mountains and the sky high above. All this points to an overall symbolism in which the oak tree, monumentalized to the status of protagonist, is a metaphor for growth and decay or for human life in general. The painting's identically-sized pendant, the Moonrise by the Sea, is also in the Nationalgalerie, Berlin.",

They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character. An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle.",

It is emphasized even today that side by side with inspirations from Venice and Verona, the work reflects the influences of the art of Burgundy and the Rhineland. This opinion is partly due to the fact that even in the period of the International Gothic such a representation lacking any spatiality was very rare in Italy. Appropriate to its theme (which is a mystic vision and not an episode that took place in reality), it is in the irrational idiom of the former that the picture evokes the marriage of the Child Jesus and St Catherine of Alexandria. The figures are improbably floating in shining, golden space. There would be no point in discussing surroundings or space, since the ground, the throne and the airy background are all of the same immaterial radiance. Nothing interprets their relationship to one another. We cannot see the back of the throne, nor the spot where it touches the ground, or whether it has a pedestal and if so what it is like. Only the decorative contours of its arms are discernible in front of the dark areas provided by the figures of St Antony Abbot and St John the Baptist. Since the milieu is undefinable we cannot state where the figures touch the ground. With one exception we cannot see their feet, indeed, even the hems of their garments seem to have a life of their own, floating in waves, instead of spreading on the ground. By this Michelino da Besozzo intensified up to the point of absurdity the homogeneity of the background, which can be seen in Stefano da Verona's picture too. However, a vision is convincing only when it contains realistic elements too. And what we can see in this picture, namely the five figures, are depicted with delicate transitions of value from light to shade, which convey the soft features and the soft body of the Child Jesus. Their complexions display a wide variety of snow-white, pale pink, golden brown and dark-brown tones. The rhythmic arrangement of shapes and colours results in an extraordinarily well balanced composition. The Virgin's head, rising in the middle, is surrounded by the semicircle of the other four heads. At the same time the dark draperies of the three figures in the back enclose the light areas of colour displayed by the body of the Child and the face and garments of St Catherine, thus presenting a fine equilibrium of colours in the composition.",

In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite. Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building. Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal.",

        "description": "This is the leftt wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The right wing showing the Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels is in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp. Estienne Chevalier, who came from Melun, was French Ambassador to England in 1445 and six years later became Treasurer to Charles VII of France. He presented the diptych of which this panel forms the left wing, to his native town; on this wing he had himself painted next to his patron saint, Stephen. The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times. Originally the donor and the saint were looking towards the Madonna, who occupied the right wing of the diptych; this panel found its way into the Antwerp Museum. According to a description of the paintings by Denis Godefroy in 1661, the original frames were covered in blue velvet. Round each picture were strands of gold and silver thread, in which the donor's initials were woven in pearls. There were also gilded medallions on which stories of the saints were represented. Tradition has it - and there is considerable supporting evidence - that the Madonna's features are those of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful and influential mistress of Charles VII. Known portraits of her certainly do not conflict with this hypothesis. Her relationship with Estienne Chevalier was not entirely political, and an eighteenth-century inscription on the back of the Antwerp panel tells us that the diptych of Melun was endowed by Estienne following a vow he made on her death in 1450. The diptych was in the chancel of the Church of Notre-Dame at Melun, south of Paris, from 1461 until about 1775, when the two halves became separated. The date of Agnes Sorel's death is not the only reason for assuming that the diptych was painted around 1450. At any later period the cut of Estienne's robe would no longer have been in fashion. A few years earlier, between 1443 and 1447, Fouquet had been in Italy and the background of the Berlin panel is clearly the result of what he saw there. After returning from the south, he settled in his birthplace, Tours. From then on he worked for Charles VII and the court and became the leading exponent of the French Court style.",

He built a grand house completed in 1913 in an 'Old Nordic' style, which contains his collections of art and handicrafts (now the Zorn Museum). Zorn actively encouraged the revival of traditional local customs, arts and crafts, which were being threatened by industrialization and urbanization. Many of his paintings also had motifs from Dalecarlian folklore, among them Midsummer's Day Dance (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm). Zorn said of this painting: 'I regard this work as containing all my deepest feelings', and it has become one of the major pictorial expressions of Swedish National Romanticism. It shows peasants from the Mora district, who, having erected a tall pole decorated with flowers and greenery, dance under the stars until sunrise. It reveals Zorn's interest in capturing the particular atmosphere of the light Nordic summer nights, for in order to render the opalescent light, which casts no shadows, Zorn painted Midsummer Dance after sunset in June and July. He succeeded in depicting the enchantment and exuberance of a night devoted to celebrating the return of light after the long northern winter. In such works Zorn provided a transition from the optimistic naturalism of the 1880s to the vitalist currents that marked the early years of the 20th century in Scandinavian art, and he was in general untouched by the Symbolist-inspired, melancholic and nostalgic tones of its art of the 1890s.",

In Buytewech's Banquet in the Open Air all the typical elements of genre are already manifest, even though the painting clearly reflects a transitional style. Transitional it is, not only in the general setting, which is curiously theatrical, but also in its stiff composition. The presentation of the different motives which together constitute the scene is painfully precise and orthodox. On a stage-like floor, marked off from a garden by theatrical architecture, are two groups of people, both consisting of richly dressed ladies and flashy men. On the middle of the floor a table is set. One group is still seated next to the table; the other is standing on the right, displaying themselves and also, one has the impression, the table. Within this setting, two types of symbol have been introduced: symbols of Luxury (among others: the golden vases and decanters, the peacock on the table, the not quite contemporary fancy dress) and symbols of Vanity (the musical instruments on the floor).",

Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness. Even if the objects are arranged so that they seem close enough to touch, they are nevertheless distanced. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme.",

Joris Vekemans was a prominent AAntwerp merchant, as witnessed by the wealth displayed in these portraits. He died in 1625, shortly after the birth of his sixth child. He probably commissioned all portraits at once, some time before January 1625. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that two of the portraits are not entirely finished, probably due to the unexpected death of the man who ordered them. The portraits are all conceived as pairs. De Vos treated the subjects in each pair in a similar manner, as we can see from the corresponding poses, background and colouring, which create a strong sense of unity between them. With his portraits of the Vekemans family Cornelis de Vos left behind the stereotypical faces of his early works, creating instead a series of very realistic characters - the children's faces are charming, imbued with a sense of youthful pride and shyness. It is, of course, the treatment of the face that lends a successful portrait its expressive power. The portrait of Elisabeth Vekemans is incomplete, as we see from the unfinished background, the somewhat casual execution of the skirt and the absence of the mainly deep red, intensely colourful details like the socks, tie, jewellery and so on that might have enlivened the sombre, green palette. Even so, the portrait stands out for the sureness with which the face is rendered and the daring highlights in the outer garment, which skillfully suggest the material. The portrait is fairly unusual for its time. Life-size, full-length portraits of young girls only really appear in De Vos's work from the 1630s onwards.",

She stands between two mirrors held up by an admirer in such a way that she can see herself and her admirer and we can see her from both front and back. This arrangement refers to the claims of painting to surpass sculpture, by presenting an all-round view with colour as a bonus. Her expression has little to do with vanity, a common gloss on images of women before a mirror, and shows an unaffected and dawning delight in her own attractions which the viewer, like her admirer, is expected to share.

The man is gazing at the observer and holding up a medal bearing the profile of the head of Cosimo de' Medici, who died in 1464. Botticelli set the medal into the painting as a gilded plaster cast. The painting is a a half length portrait in front of an extensive light landscape with a river, and the man's head projects above the horizon. The light, which falls on the subject from the left, clearly shapes his striking features, and there are stronger shadows on the side of his face closer to the observer. The poor drawing of his hands makes the experimental nature of this portrait more than clear. It is one of the earliest Italian portraits to make the hands a part of the portrait's theme. The commemorative medal of Cosimo dates from about 1465-70 and has given rise to an entire series of suggestions concerning the identity of the man depicted.

On the main side of the fresco we see St George with his eyes raised towards Mary as she is carried upwards to Christ and God, who is holding a crown above the starry nimbus around her head.

        "description": "The artist is one of the most original and creative figures of the German Renaissance. Born in the village of Schwäbisch-Gmund in south-west Germany, his family established close connections with Strasbourg. It was here that Baldung worked for most of his life, apart from four years in Nuremberg spent in Dürer's workshop (1503-c. 1507) and five years in Freiburg-im-Bresgau (1512-17) where he painted his masterpiece, The Coronation of the Virgin, for the high altar of the Münster. Baldung was a prolific artist and his oeuvre comprises numerous prints and designs for book illustrations and stained-glass, as well as paintings and drawings. He was the most individual of Dürer's assistants and his style and treatment of colour are remarkably expressive. The range of subject matter in Baldung's work matches his technical dexterity: religious and mythological themes, in addition to a fascination for witches, are vividly, almost shockingly, handled. In achieving this emphatic style, Baldung was influenced by Grünewald, Cranach, and artists of the Danube school. It is clear that he was inspired by the spirit of the Reformation and this encouraged an element of dualism in his work, most evident during the 1520s. Strasbourg was sympathetic to Reformist ideas and the artist himself was buried in the Protestant cemetery. Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary is an early work; it is, in fact, the first dated portrait in Baldung's oeuvre, painted on his return to Strasbourg two years after The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Nuremburg, Germänisches Nationalmuseum). The style, combining linearity with a perfectly controlled understanding of the liquidity of paint, is clearly dependent upon Dürer, especially his portraits including that of Burkhard von Speyer in the Royal Collection, painted while Dürer was in Venice from 1506 to 1507. However, the liveliness of the almost quixotic characterisation is typical of Baldung. At the upper edge in the centre, as part of the signature, is an image of an owl attacking a bird on a branch, which perhaps symbolises the conflict between good and evil or day and night. This piece of symbolism should perhaps be seen in the context of the rosary held by the sitter. The painting was part of the collection of Italian, German and early Netherlandish pictures formed by Prince Ludwig Kraft Ernst von Oettingen Wallerstein (1791-1870), which Prince Albert accepted as surety for a financial loan in 1847. The collection was put on display in Kensington Palace in 1848 in order to encourage a buyer, but this ploy failed and so the pictures came into the possession of Prince Albert. In 1863 Queen Victoria presented twenty-five of the best paintings to the National Gallery, London, in memory of the Prince Consort and in accordance with his wishes. Like several other paintings in the Oettingen Wallerstein collection, Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary previously belonged to Count Joseph von Rechberg (1769-1833).",

Six (1618-1700) came from a noble Huguenot family which had fled to Amsterdam from Saint Omer in France at the end of the sixteenth century and amassed a fortune in the textile trade and from silk dyeing. Six was involved in the family business until he entered civic politics in Amsterdam, serving as burgomaster of the city in 1691. Passionately interested in the arts, particularly poetry, Six was a member of the so-called Muiderkring (Muiden circle) which gathered around Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft, and he published volumes of poetry and plays. He was an avid collector of works of art - Dutch and Italian masters, antique sculpture, engraved gems - and travelled widely, including an extended trip to Italy in 1640. Six owned a number of paintings by Rembrandt, among them the grisaille Preaching of John the Baptist (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie). Their relationship was, however, one of friendship rather than simply that of patron and artist. Rembrandt etched the title page for Six's tragedy Medea and made two drawings for his Album Amicorum in 165Z.  This portrait, which is still owned by a direct descendant of the sitter, also Jan Six, captures the moment as Six pauses while putting on his gloves just before leaving the house. The hands, gloves and red cloak are painted very broadly in powerful strokes with a loaded brush, but the face, with its marvellous expression of momentary abstraction, has been heavily and precisely worked and reworked. It is one of Rembrandt's most sensitive and effective portraits and a remarkable tribute to the friendship between the two men. Three years later Rembrandt etched a portrait of Six standing at his window reading, with books and manuscripts in the foreground and a painting hanging on the wall: it is a study of Six as poet and collector.",

The name \"Van der Meer from Delft\" occurred for the first time in a catalog dating from 1806, to be changed back to Flinck in 1817. From 1826 to 1860, the appellation was altered to Pieter de Hooch. It is only since 1862 that the correct identification obtains. The only Dutch provenance that could possibly apply is the sale Pieter van der Lip, Amsterdam, 1712, no. 22, \"A Woman Reading in a Room, by van der Meer of Delft fl 110.\" Unfortunately, the text is not specific enough to distinguish it from the one at the Rijksmuseum, Woman in Blue Reading a Letter. The above underlines the difficulties inherent to the establishment of Vermeer's catalog. Not a single work can be traced back to the painter's studio, nor are there any letters or contracts extant. The task of attribution rests squarely upon the shoulders of the individual critic, which explains the multiplicity of divergent opinions. In this painting, a young woman stands in the center of the composition, facing in profile an open window to the left. In the foreground is a table covered with the same Oriental rug encountered in the Woman Asleep. On it is the identical Delft plate with fruit. The window reflects the girl's features, while to the right the large green curtain forms a deceptive frame. She is precisely silhouetted against a bare wall that reflects the light and envelops her in its luminosity. We are here confronted with one of the salient aspects of Vermeer's sensibility and originality. It is the stillness that stands out, the inner absorption, the remoteness from the outer world. She concentrates entirely upon the letter, holding it firmly and tautly, while she absorbs its content with utmost attention. In the technique, the artist avows again Rembrandtesque derivation. He paints in small fatty dabs to model the forms, and obtains the desired effects by means of impasto highlights opposed to the deeper tonalities - just as the master from Leyden was wont to do. The painting is relatively large, and the smallness of the figure as opposed to its surroundings stresses immateriality and depersonalization. Vermeer considerably changed the composition in the course of execution. Much has been written about the trompe-l'oeil effect of the curtain. It is a pictorial artifice used by many other Dutch masters and in keeping with an old European tradition. Rembrandt, Gerard Dou, Nicolaes Maes, and many still-life and even landscape painters made use of such curtains as a means of simulating effects that now seem theatrical. The light background can be found in many paintings by Carel Fabritius, the Goldfinch from 1654 at the Mauritshuis in The Hague being the most famous example.",

The papal authorities demolished his residences, and the only space that was spared was the Bentivoglio family chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore. It may be that the subject matter of its canvases by Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia, which included a depiction of some of the misfortunes and deaths that had dogged the Bentivoglio, helped to save them. The paintings in the chapel consist of two allegorical depictions, the Triumph of Fame and the Triumph of Death, and a votive image that is one of the most  important visual documents attesting to the family's considerable self-esteem. In it Giovanni II and his wife Ginevra Sforza, his predecessor's widow, kneel in gratitude on either side of an enthroned Madonna. Their numerous daughters and sons are arrayed in the foreground before them. This painting was commissioned to celebrate the timely discovery of the Malvezzi conspiracy on November 1488, a bit of luck that saved the lives of the Bentivoglio and preserved their rule over the city.",

We can see the same arrangement on this icon. Christ is standing on a sharp rocky outcrop in a radiant white garment, giving the blessing with His right hand and holding a closed scroll in His left. He is surrounded by an oval aureole of light, in which is inscribed a rectangle with inwardly curving sides, from which rays emanate towards Elijah and Moses, each standing on his own mountain summit in an attitude of veneration. Three further rays strike the three disciples, who have thrown themselves to the ground in prayer. To this basic scheme of the depiction of the event, this icon adds two others, which respectively precede and follow the Transfiguration. On the left, Christ is climbing the mountain with the three disciples, while on the right we see the descent.",

Assigned in 1916 to Mattia Preti, the canvas is considered one of the best of the Calabrian painter's youthful works. The painting, dated to the fourth decade of the century, represents Preti's first ambitious attempt to distance himself from the Manfredian models of his youth. At the same time, the Roman neo-Venetian experience, which would prove fundamental to his development as a painter, is just beginning to manifest itself. This painting is a key work for the study of Preti, as it shows him in a delicate moment of stylistic passage. Abandoning his earlier predilection for genre scenes set in a closed room with artificial light, Preti is for the first time attempting a forceful history picture in an open, outdoor setting. The brilliant chromatic range, all based on primary colours, was revealed by a recent restoration. The vibrant blue of Aeneas' mantle, the yellow of his tunic and the resplendent white of the drapery that covers Ascanius remind us that Preti had already encountered the art of Poussin and the neo-Venetian ambient in Rome. The epic subject, taken from the Aeneid, depicts the flight of Aeneas from Troy after the defeat and sack of the city by the Greeks. With his son Ascanius at his side, he carries his old and infirm father Anchises on his shoulders. Anchises clutches the penates, the household gods. In the narrative Aeneas' wife Creusa here set in the margin of the composition, would be lost and killed in the confusion of the flight. This subject found a new popularity at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, notably through the enthusiasm of Cardinal Scipione Borghese. The connections, emphasized by Virgil and Ovid, between the flight of Aeneas and the founding of Rome had obvious appeal to the modern Romans. Ascanius, according to legend, would grow up to found the city of Albalonga, where Rome's own founders Romulus and Remus were born.",

The selected theme was episodes from the life of Antenor, the mythological founder of the city of Padua. The scenes are displayed on the walls of the vast place in four large compartments. The dado below the compartments, painted in faux marmorino, circles the perimeter of the room.

Lucy's fiancé, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel. The story continues on the main panel of the altarpiece which depicts St Lucy Seized by the Panders. In this scene Paschasius summons the panders to \"invite the crowd to have pleasure with this woman, and let them abuse her body until she dies; but the panders tried to carry her off, the Holy Ghost made her so heavy that they were unable to move her.\" At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fiancé assists the panders in their fruitless efforts. The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. The extension of this fourth scene across more than half of the width of the entire predella, represents a highly original approach to predella design. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella.",

        "description": "Signature: Signed top left. Provenance: The provenance of this painting cannot be traced back very far. All earlier documents or sales catalogs cited by Blankert are pure guesswork. Vermeer seems to have painted a number of \"heads,\" and various cited 'tronie', as they were called, cannot be further identified. We only know for certain that the work was purchased at the beginning of 1882 for the collection A. A. des Tombe of The Hague for fl. 2.30 in the sale Braam of the same city. The des Tombe collection was a public collection and bequeathed the picture in 1903 to the Mauritshuis. This charming portrait of a girl is unfortunately in a very poor state of conservation and suffered from numerous extensive restorations. It is furthermore marred by an ugly pattern of cracks. Nevertheless, it became famous after its rediscovery and was dubbed the \"Gioconda of the North\" by many enthusiastic critics. Fortunately, enough of the original is left to permit the savouring of a truly outstanding and partly exotic work. The girl is seen against a neutral, dark background, very nearly black, which establishes a powerful three-dimensionality of effect. Seen from the side, the girl is turning to gaze at us, and her lips are slightly parted, as if she were about to speak to us. It is an illusionist approach often adopted in Dutch art. She is inclining her head slightly to one side as if lost in thought, yet her gaze is keen. The girl is dressed in an unadorned, brownish-yellow jacket, and the shining white collar contrasts clearly against it. The blue turban represents a further contrast, while a lemon-yellow, veil-like cloth falls from its peak to her shoulders. Vermeer used plain, pure colours in this painting, limiting the range of tones. As a result, the number of sections of colour are small, and these are given depth and shadow by the use of varnish of the same colour. The girl's headdress has an exotic effect. Turbans were a popular fashionable accessory in Europe as early as the 15th century, as is shown by Jan van Eyck's probable self portrait, now in the National Gallery in London. During the wars against the Turks, the remote way of life and foreign dress of the \"enemy of Christendom\" proved to be very fascinating. A particularly noticeable feature of Vermeer's painting is the large, tear-shaped pearl hanging from the girl's ear; part of it has a golden sheen, and it stands out from the part of the neck which is in shadow. In his Introduction to the Devout Life (1608), which was published in a Dutch translation in 1616, the mystic St Francis De Sales (1567-1622) wrote, \"Both now and in the past it has been customary for women to hang pearls from their ears; as Pliny observed, they gain pleasure from the sensation of the swinging pearls touching them. But I know that God's friend, Isaac, sent earrings to chaste Rebecca as a first token of his love. This leads me to think that this jewel has a spiritual meaning, namely that the first part of the body that a man wants, and which a woman must loyally protect, is the ear; no word or sound should enter it other than the sweet sound of chaste words, which are the oriental pearls of the gospel.\" From this it is clear that the pearl in Vermeer's painting is a symbol of chastity. The oriental aspect, which is mentioned in the above extract, is further emphasised by the turban. The reference to Isaac and Rebecca suggests that this picture could have been painted on the occasion of this young woman's marriage. So to that extent it is a portrait. There is surely a similar explanation for the Head of a Girl dressed in a smart, grey dress (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). One must admire the artist's technique, which features application of the pigments in juxtaposition and melting, avoiding precise lines, and therefore blurring the contours of different colours so as to obtain effects that foreshadow those of the impressionists. The dark backgrounds that Vermeer chose in these two portraits enhance the plasticity of the models.",

At the left of the composition, a woman accompanies an adolescent, who seems unable to see her. She holds a book in one hand and a stick in the other. A lion, symbol of courage, stands next to her naked feet. This woman likely represents an allegory of power, thus characterising youth. The rest of the composition contains an ensemble of elements clearly pertaining to the world of sorcery. Indeed, death and love are in question here. Evil spirits, a demon holding a mirror off to the right, and the Devil, in the form of an old woman on a goat that dominates the scene, all feature. A pact has seemingly been made with the Devil: the protagonist has sold his soul for eternity, in exchange for a temporary allocation of his power. The central scene represents, in all probability, the Devil himself who comes to claim the soul of the hanged man, which passes through a ring - symbol of eternity - placed above the gallows. Other elements holding traces of sorcery are represented here: the fire in the centre of the scene, a symbol of physical, moral and mystical transmutation.

If we are to believe the monastic chronicle written in 1619 by Don Fortunato Oimo, kings and princes had clamored for copies of the picture. Certainly, it is the festive mood of the picture, set in a world very familiar to contemporary viewers, that must have prompted demands of this kind.

On the basis of the identification of the standing young man to the right as the artist's self portrait, a dating to the end of the 1640's was also proposed. This dating is compatible with the apparent age of the \"self-portrait\", as Cavallino would have been just over thirty years old at that time. Such an inclusion is consistent with what we know about Cavallino, who included images of himself in eight of his paintings. According to the sources, Cavallino trained in the workshop of Massimo Stanzione in the early 1640's. In the previous decade he had, however, already developed his own personal style. This picture is a splendid example of that manner, a subtle synthesis of the artist's various maturing experiences. A recent restoration has more fully revealed the extraordinary chromatic range of Cavallino, which is based on a variety of cool tones; azures, blues, and grays. These are enriched by the rich and suffused brown tones of the figures in the middle ground and the almost monochromatic rendering of the figures at the right.",

A Latin couplet above the merchant's head intimates how faithfully the artist has rendered every aspect of the man : `What you see here, this picture, shows Georg's features and figure such is his eye in real life, such is the shape of his cheeks.' Yet it is clear from the very form this couplet takes that the picture is meant to convey more than outward appearances and to underline the humanist milieu in which the merchant wished to be seen. The same mood is implicit in a Latin motto inscribed on the rear wall immediately beside a pair of scales: `Nulla sine merore voluptas' (`No joy without sorrow'). The merchant is depicted standing in his workroom, behind a table covered with a richly embroidered cloth. Among the many objects on the table and the wall which illustrate his trade, the Venetian-glass vase, containing carnations and other flowers, clearly has a special significance; in the medieval language of symbols the carnation was a sign of betrothal. From the shelf in the top right-hand corner several keys, signet-rings and a spherical container are hanging, the latter presumably containing string. On the table is a pewter writing-stand with goose-feathers, ink, sand, wax disks and sealing-wax. Beside it are a pair of scissors, a signet-ring and a seal. Near the table's edge, precisely placed in the centre foreground, stands a small table-clock which, together with the fragile glass vase and the perishable flowers, is a reminder of the passage of time, as was the hour-glass in earlier pictures. The name Georg Gisze occurs frequently and appears several times in various styles of handwriting on the documents attached to the wall. From the letter in the merchant's hand one gathers that he has been corresponding with a brother in Germany. The subject of the portrait, the son of an alderman, was born in Danzig in 1497. Holbein painted him in London in 1532. Three years later Gisze married in Danzig, and we may assume that the portrait was commissioned in anticipation of the marriage. The painting was in the Duke of Orleans' collection in 1727 and appeared in the inventories until 1788. The collection was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1793 and put up for auction. The Swiss publisher and copper-engraver Christian von Mechel acquired the picture and tried in vain to persuade the Basel Library to buy it. For about twenty years it remained in Switzerland without finding a purchaser, until Edward Solly acquired it at a very low price. In 1821 it found its way into the Berlin Museum with the rest of the Solly Collection.",

The panel belonged to an altarpiece devoted to the story of John the Baptist which was painted in 1496 for the Carthusian monastery of Miraflores near Burgos. The original form of the altarpiece has been partially reconstructed. Its central panel was the Baptism of Christ, now in a Madrid collection. Each wing consisted of at lest two panels placed one on top of the other. Although the work of Juan de Flandes is not really Southern Netherlandish in character, we nevertheless detect the clear influence of painters from Ghent and Bruges, especially Hugo van der Goes. He uses painterly techniques to create a strange atmosphere. The bright lighting and accentuation of the green, red and orange sections generate a nervous tension.

In the impressive Madonna in Red - also known as the Durán Madonna, after a former owner - there is an architectural niche very like the portals of the altarpiece, again with an angel hovering with a crown at the apex.

The two versions (executed in 1874 and 1883) of the painting Dusty Country Road commemorate the painter's visit to his homeland. A cart is moving on the road slowly, stirring up the dust painted pink by the beams of the sun. This canvas is a pink vision flooded with light, a snapshot almost approaching plein-air painting. It sheds light on Munkácsy's new approach to Nature, and it also reveals a potential path, which the painter, unfortunately, never pursued. Contemporary critiques often called this small masterpiece impressionist: he himself, however, refused to have anything to do with this style. The only other painting in which such a painterly approach is evident is \"Dusty Road I\": in the paintings to come he returned to the style of realism.",

At the centre, the figure of Christ is portrayed as a simple man, but his stance is so solemn as to make him look as majestic as a Greek god. His torso and his legs are circular and solid, like the tree on the left; the holy dove, like a little cloud, fits into a patch of sky amidst the foliage of the tree, rendered with almost Impressionistic strokes. The three angels on the left, with their pale but round faces, are reminiscent of the groups of children sculpted by Luca della Robbia for the Cantoria in Florence Cathedral (1432-38): and even their blonde hair, decorated with garlands, is clearly inspired by Luca's models. The face of the angel in the centre, with his fixed gaze, brings to mind Domenico Veneziano paintings in the mid-1430s.",

An intimation that the picture was perhaps done during Botticelli's stay in Rome can be seen in the groom in the background on the right who is attempting to bring his horse under control; Botticelli probably adapted this motif from the classical sculptures of the Dioscuri, the horse-tamers, in Rome. In contrast to Botticelli's earlier versions of the Adoration, the Virgin and the Christ Child now form the painting's main focal point, uncontested by any of the figures accompanying them. As in the Adoration done for Guasparre del Lama, those present here are arrayed around the Virgin in a semicircle; in this picture, however, Botticelli has opened up the semicircle towards the observer, so that the latter's gaze may reach the Virgin unhindered. At the same time, all those involved, their postures and gestures, are directed towards the Mother of God, lending the painting a dramatic unity which the earlier Adorations lacked. The artist's recording of the figures' various reactions demonstrates once again the importance for Botticelli of Alberti's treatise on painting. The art theoretician recommended for the edification of the observer not only the greatest variation in the possible palette of emotions but also the depiction of people of differing age, together with alternation in the perspectives offered by the figures, who should be presented from various sides in three-quarter and half profile or from the front. Botticelli's wealth of variation in the fashioning of his figures fulfilled all of these demands, yet without losing the central focus of the picture's content.",

It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. This led to the At the Races in the Countryside. Degas never tires of the theme of the racecourse. On September 27, 1881, the newspaper \"Le Globe\" started publishing Major Muybridge's photographs of a galloping horse, and Degas used them for his sketches. The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. This is how Degas painted the horses racing in the background of At the Races in the Countryside of 1869. Degas exhibited this moderately colourful work at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri. The people in the carriage are caught in their fashionable elegance.",

After its discovery in 1865, the fresco cycle to which this work belongs was detached and progressively moved to the Brera during the late nineteenth century. At one time, the signature and date, \"Ambrosius Bergognonis 1495,\" could be read below the figure of St. Catherine. The aristocratic appearance of this female figure is based entirely on the circling patterns of the robe, which builds up an ogee form embracing vibrant spatial rhythms. These are most marked in the arm, the wheel and the somewhat heavily rendered drapery. The well-mannered monumentality is enhanced by the yellow colour. In the embroidery of the bodice the yellow has the quality of a goldsmith's work; it ripples as if there were a slight movement in the air.",

By the time it was done Saenredam had been painting pictures of identifiable churches for more than two decades; however, juxtaposition of any by Saenredam with Houckgeest's New Church shows straightaway what is novel about his painting. In Saenredam's church interiors the line of vision is always at an angle of about 90º to the centre of the nave or to the wall of the building he depicts. In the Hamburg picture Houckgeest, like Saenredam, has kept the field of vision relatively high, but he had the brilliant new idea of shifting his position to the side to give an angle of about 45º to the principal axis of the New Church. The new position creates intriguingly intricate diagonal views across the church. He also has considerably shortened the distance between the viewer and the closest architectural element portrayed, the massive column near the centre. Although the best-known monument in the Netherlands is subordinated to the huge pier and is partially obscured by another one, the allegorical sculptures figure of Freedom on Willem's tomb gains emphasis by the new scheme. The general tonality of the painting is light, yet there is a striking gain in contrast in the values of his colours, a pronounced change from Saenredam's delicate monochromatic mode. Bright rays of sunlight, which are never found in Saemnredam's interiors, now enter the church and relive the powerful weight of the columns. People in the church have gained emphasis too, and their clothing provides some vivid colour accents.",

        "description": "Antonio Ponce was an apprentice and, probably, an assistant of Juan van der Hamen who enjoyed a long career at the court of Madrid as a specialist painter of still-lifes and flower pieces. This flower painting, and its pendant in the same private collection, representing glass vases of flowers standing on a stone ledge, follows the most conventional of formats for flower paintings. As flower paintings became important decorative features in the homes of the period, they were increasingly conceived as pendant paintings and, indeed, as decorative series of works. Moreover, the stone ledges on which the flowers rest enter the pictures from opposite sides, a feature that would have permitted their owner to hang them on either side of a central element, such as a window, a painting or piece of furniture, with the perspective of the ledges appearing to converge on a central point. Ponce has meticulously studied the play of light on the petals of the flowers, carefully tracing their edges with thin strokes of white paint and applying highlights as a series of hatched brushstrokes in light paint. Personal factors probably explain the depth of Van der Hamen's influence on Ponce's flower paintings: the older artist was a pioneer in this genre in Madrid and had taught the younger artist to paint. Ponce's faith in the aesthetic principles of Van der Hamen appear to be in direct contrast with the spirited touch exemplified in the works of his younger contemporaries, such as Juan de Arellano and Gabriel de la Corte.",

The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues. More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south. Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions. But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident. Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration. The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light. From this time onward golden sunlight becomes the all-pervading element in Cuyp's paintings. It spreads warmth and beauty over the Dutch countryside, where sturdy animals - most often cows - take place of human heroes.",

This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezieres, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities. The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them. Having passed from the influence of Bastiani and Antonello da Messina to a meditation on the works of Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio, Benedetto Diana was able, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, to absorb the influences of the most modern of painters working in Venice, of Lotto and Giorgione in particular. He showed a constant, natural predisposition for large-scale monumental compositions however and for the precise spacial geometry of late fifteenth century tradition. This inclination is also clearly displayed in the 'telero' painted for the Hostel Chamber of the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista. According to the 'Descrizione' of the Scuola published in 1787, the painting tells the story of how the four-year-old son of Alvise Finetti, 'scrivan alla Camera degli imprestidi' recovered after sustaining mortal injuries in a fall from the loft of his house. Especially evocative is the description of the interior courtyard of a fifteenth century Venetian palace reminiscent in its freely atmospheric style of Carpaccio.",

In contrast, the fresco beneath it, directly above the altarpiece, is devoted to the Sassetti family's private history. In 1478, the year of the Pazzi plot, their son Teodoro died; but a few months later Nera Corsi Sassetti gave birth to a second son. As they felt him to be a gift from God, they made yet another change in the plans for the altar wall in their mortuary chapel. Ghirlandaio had to abandon his design for a scene showing the appearance of Saint Francis in Arles, for which preliminary drawings still exist, and paint the Resurrection of the Boy. This was how the Sassetti intended to express their gratitude for their new-bon son Teodoro II.

The present picture shows St Bartolomew and the flayed skin. In the middle of the Last Judgment fresco on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, to the right beneath Christ the Judge, our eye is drawn to the place where the apostle and martyr St Bartholomew is displaying his attributes. In his right hand he is holding the knife with which, as legend had it, he was skinned alive; in his left, he is holding the skin itself, including that of the face, with its tortured folds and demonic hollows. Beholders have always noted the particular similarity of this tattered facial bladder with the famous gnarled and melancholic face of the artist. This dark countenance of the 'divino artista' was known from paintings by fellow artists, and in at least one case from a sculpture by Michelangelo himself. In the Pietà in Florence, the figure of Nicodemus, who is holding the body of Jesus, just taken down from the Cross, close to his breast in sorrow, is probably also a hidden self-portrait. And it has also always struck beholders that the flayed face in the Last Judgment bears no resemblance to the face of the saint sitting on his cloud. Instead, the apostle evinces a fateful and unmistakable similarity with Michelangelo's notorious contemporary Pietro Aretino. Those among the fresco's beholders who recognized this at the time would certainly have heard too of the private feud between the moody giant of art and the intriguing head of the literati.",

Velázquez's sympathy for the fools and dwarfs of the Spanish court is obvious: in the pathos and humane understanding demonstrated by the single portraits with which he (and he alone) paid tribute to them. A particularly impressive portrait is Velázquez's painting of the dwarf Don Diego de Acedo, alias El Primo (The Cousin), probably commissioned by the court and executed at Fraga in about 1644. (The dwarf was called El Primo because he boasted of being the relative of Velázquez.) Like the midget Sebastian de Morra, who served in the retinue of the Infante Don Fernando and Prince Baltasar Carlos, El Primo is shown sitting, and is viewed slightly from below. The effect of presenting them from this dignified aspect is to raise their status in the eyes of the spectator. El Primo is portrayed leafing through the pages of an enormous tome. His small size makes the books surrounding him appear even more gigantic than they are. His occupation here is undoubtedly a reference to his administrative duties at the court. At the same time, it is probably an example of humanist satirical jest, which would often decry the senseless writing and reading of books as a contemptible vice. Contemporary spectators would never have accepted that a dwarf knew how to use the attributes of a scholar; the artist thus seems to be using an apparently grotesque discrepancy to poke fun at the pseudo-scholars of his day.",

The process continued and intensified in the early part of the 17th century, when the Southern Netherlands enjoyed a period of stability and prosperity thanks to the peace policies pursued by the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. Art and artists were major beneficiaries. Antwerp was a wealthy city, whose churches were decorated with unusual splendour: Catholic worship had to be especially glorious in this place where the Protestants head recently held sway. In 1611, the Arquebusiers - Antwerp's civic guard - commissioned a Descent from the Cross by their illustrious townsman Rubens for their altar in the cathedral. The dean of the guild at that time was Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox, who appear in the painting. The Descent from the Cross is the second of Rubens's great altarpieces for the Antwerp Cathedral. It shows the Visitation, and the Presentation of the Temple on either side of the Descent from the Cross. (The first triptych of the Raising of the Cross was executed in 1611-12.) His rich painterly Baroque technique incorporated both elements of Venetian design and also the composition and lighting of the Roman period of Caravaggio. But the result is purely Flemish. Although at first sight the themes presented in the triptych seem extremely wide-ranging, they are actually linked, for St Christopher was the Arquebusiers' patron saint. When the triptych was closed, all that worshippers could see was this scene from the legend of St Christopher, whose Greek name 'Christophorus' means 'Christ-bearer'. This fact forms the key to the entire painting, in which the friends and holy women in the centre panel, and Mary and Simeon in the wings are also 'Christ-bearers'.",

Jesus, after taking Peter, James and John with him up on a mountain, transfigured: his face shone with extraordinary splendour and his clothes became dazzlingly white. Immediately after, Moses and Elijah appeared to speak with him and when Peter tried to speak, a cloud enveloped them in its shade and a voice declared the divine descent of Jesus. The transcendent and metaphysical nature of Jesus' appearance on Mount Tabor is a perfect subject for the increasingly Baroque tone that characterised Giordano's work from the period of his Florentine frescoes, through to his departure for Spain (1682-1692). The characteristic mature style of the Transfiguration makes it a precursor of later works, inspired by the vision of Rubens and Bernini. The strong influences of Bernini and close alignment with the works of Baciccio can be seen in the search for brand new effects using light: in fact, light is shown like a cascade, pouring from the background to the foreground, revealing shapes through backlighting. The artist applied colour directly over a very fine brown wash, without preparation, creating effects of extraordinary lightness.",

Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.",

The two lateral sides each feature three scenes from the life of St Ursula, while the two narrower ends show the saints and the 11,000 virgins, the Virgin and Child and the donors. The decoration of the shrine occupies a central position in Hans Memling's wide-ranging oeuvre and demonstrates both his outstanding qualities and his limitations as an artist. His energies are devoted above all to the portrayal of single figures in graceful poses, to the realistic observation of detail, and to an exquisite palette which is often reminiscent of miniature painting. Although Memling is a narrator, dramatic climax is foreign to his temperament even in a scene of martyrdom. He lacks depth of expression and the ability to convincingly \"stage-manage\" crowd scenes. Instead, he provides a wealth of inexhaustibly varied details which together \"add up\" into the overall composition. A comparison with Carpaccio's more or less contemporaneous treatment of the St Ursula legend is particularly illuminating. Memling was clearly familiar with Cologne at first hand, as demonstrated by his accurate portrayal of the city skyline in the background, showing the unfinished cathedral, the distinctive tower of Great St Martin's church and, on the left, the church of St Cunibert. Dirk De Vos, the leading modern expert on Memling, has related how thoroughly the artist researched this work, visiting the places that he was to paint in order to get the buildings exactly right. The Rhine itself acts as a unifying thread running through the different episodes in the cycle. \"On one side of the reliquary\", writes De Vos, \"the ships are coming from the north, and cast anchor on the left bank, so that the town is on their right. On the other side, the ships are sailing towards the north, running along the right bank as they advance downstream, and thus the city is to their left. Everything is so finely observed, that one can reconstruct the angle from which the artist viewed the city with great precision, proof that Memling really did make drawings from the viewpoints he had chosen for his pictures of the ships at rest on both legs of their journey.\"' Rarely has an artist gone further in the pursuit of pictorial truth, a feat that is all the more astonishing given the very small size of the pictures.",

        "description": "As early as 1442 Pope Martin V had given the Medicis permission to build a private chapel with a portable family altar. The chapel, in the first floor of the Medicis' private residence, was built by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo (1396-1472) between 1446 and 1449 and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It comprises an almost square main room and, one step higher, an equally nearly square chancel. The two are separated from each other by two Corinthian pillars. Cosimo de' Medici chose Benozzo Gozzoli to decorate the chapel. The pictorial program of the chapel is also structured in two parts: the Procession of the Magi in the main room and the Adoration of the Child in the chancel with the Angels worshipping on the side walls. The ceiling is decorated by a diamond-pointed ring in a halo with a loop that bears the motto of Piero de' Medici, semper, and within it inside a glory the monogram of Christ, JHS, as used for St Bernardino of Siena. The Procession of the Magi extends across the east, south and west walls of the main room above the encircling benches. These three walls were painted in about 150 working days, and each represents one of the Three Kings. The east wall leads off with the youngest king, the story continues on the south wall with the middle king, and ends on the west wall with the oldest king. An unusual feature of this depiction is that the procession does not arrive at the manger. The adoration of the Christ Child was reserved for the contemporary observers present in the room, and their prayers were said within the important framework of the procession of the magi taking place on either side. The Procession of the Magi moves towards Filippo Lippi's altar painting of the Adoration of the Child. (The original, which was replaced with a copy in 1494, is now in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin.) Until the expulsion of the Medicis in 1494, the chapel was used to house the so-called Reliquiario del Libretto. It contains relics of the Passion and is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence. Worth mentioning are the double walls, the chapel's secret escape routes which could also be used as a hiding place and place of refuge. The double walls explain the good state of preservation of the frescoes, which were thus protected from damp. Originally it was relatively dark in the chapel, for the two small oculi only admitted a little light. In the torch and candlelight that illuminated the room, the shining gold and metal layers on the paintings must have had a powerful effect. In 1659, the Riccardi family bought the Palazzo Medici and undertook some structural changes. This included, in 1689, the building of an exterior flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. For this purpose the entrance to the chapel had to be moved. During the process, two sections of wall were cut out of the south western corner, in the procession of the oldest king. After the stairs were finished, the cut out elements were mounted on a corner of the wall projecting into the room. During the course of this, the oldest king's horse was cut up and mounted on two different segments of the wall. The empty section of wall above the new door now contains a landscape in the style of Benozzo. In addition, two windows were built on either side of the door, of which only the one on the left still exists. A large window that was integrated into the apse wall in the 19th century was bricked up again in 1929.",

        "description": "This small painting of the Madonna depicts a fragile female figure holding her newborn together with a vanquished dragon. The artist indicates her floating, vision-like quality with the use of fantastic lighting and an army of angels in concentric circles. By arranging the choir of angels in a manner reminiscent of spheres, it is also expressed that the infant Jesus in the centre of the picture is the ruler of the Universe. With a sweeping gesture and a look of concentration, the infant is shaking two bells, as if to be in concert with the angel doing the same thing on the left side of the picture. They are definitely looking at each other, and since they are the only two doing this, the action has special significance: it shows the \"conductor\" Jesus in the role of the universe's prime mover. Thus the painting clearly expresses a concept formulated by St Thomas Aquinas, according to which Jesus created the harmony of the spheres. In Geertgen's painting the three attributes of Mary (glory, sadness and joy) are represented by angels encircling the Madonna in three rings. The inner circle contains six-winged cherubs and seraphs. The angels of the second circle hold above the head of Mary the early Christian symbols of glorification, scrolls with the word \"Sanctus\" appearing on them three times. The rest bear the objects associated with the Passion: the cross, the crown of thorns, a spear, nails, a hammer, and a column. The outside circle presents a multitude of musical angels, symbolizing heavenly happiness. Here we can see nearly all of the instruments of the period: lutes, violas, double recorders, trumpets, drums, bells, horns, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies, etc. The larger keyboard instruments are located in the corners; on the organ we can see the hand-operated bellows. Obviously, the painter did not intend to reproduce the image of a real orchestra, that is why he included instruments which were never used together.",

It is one of those Virgin-and-Child compositions in the manner of the master which may be based on a Memling prototype. This prototype would then most likely be situated early in his career, around the time of the New York tondo or the Virgin of the Wernher Collection. Roughly of the same type, but full-length, is Memling's Granada Virgin. And the golden background with dark clouds is reminiscent of the wings with an Angel with an olive-branch and an Angel with a sword (Paris-London). The type is based on a composition by Rogier van der Weyden, which is itself only known from a workshop replica (Chicago, Art Institute) and from a copy in the style of Memling. Since Memling applied the type once again in the triptych with the Adoration of the Magi (Madrid, Museo del Prado), one can assume that Memling disposed of a cartoon or model of this composition.",

        "description": "Stefano di Giovanni, known as Sassetta, was among the leading Sienese artists of the century. In 1437 he received one of the most extensive, and expensive, commissions in Sienese fifteenth-century painting: a double-sided polyptych for the church of San Francesco in Borgo San Sepolcro (the native town of his younger contemporary Piero della Francesca). The figures and the scenes were to be specified by the friars. The altarpiece was painted in sections for easy transport from Siena to Borgo San Sepolcro, where it was delivered in 1444. It was dismembered in 1752; in the nineteenth century surviving fragments were sold to various collections. As far as its original appearance can now be reconstructed, this great Franciscan altarpiece, like Duccio's Maestà in Siena Cathedral, showed the Madonna and Child enthroned in the front main tier facing the congregation in the nave. The back, facing the friars in the choir, depicted Saint Francis Triumphant standing on Insubordination, Luxury and Avarice and surrounded by eight smaller scenes from his life ranged in two tiers on either side. Seven of these scenes are now in the National Gallery. The panel illustrated here is one of the best preserved. It shows one of the key events of Francis's life, cited in the process of his canonisation: the impression on his body of the five wounds of Christ. The miracle occurred on 14 September 1224 on La Verna. This forest-covered mountain near Arezzo, where he founded an eremetical convent, had been given to Francis in 1213; it is still a site of pilgrimage. There are many textual sources for Francis's biography; Sassetta, however, almost certainly based his interpretation on artistic tradition. For example, the saint was alone when Christ appeared to him, but it had become customary in painting and sculpture to show his follower Brother Leo witnessing the event, as he is doing here, looking up in wonder from his book of devotions. Giotto had already depicted Saint Francis in the same pose, kneeling and raising his arms to the six-winged seraph-Christ. Sassetta is in many ways a paradoxical painter. Like Giovanni di Paolo and all other Sienese artists, he was deeply in thrall to his great Sienese predecessors of the fourteenth century, the followers of Duccio. He had studied Florentine art of the same period as well as of his own time. Around 1432 he became acquainted with French and northern Italian miniatures. Something of all these sources is evident here, in the ornamental forms of the trees, the unrealistic ledge-like rocks of the foreground and the oblique angle at which he sets the chapel nestling in the mountain - a fourteenth-century method of suggesting perspective. At the same time as Sassetta emulated the decorative effects of archaic styles, he could not help but be influenced by the artistic advances of his day. Thus the supernatural light flooding La Verna from the seraph is virtually consistent throughout the painting. Mountain shadows darken the stuccoed façade of the chapel, with its Virgin and Child above the door; Saint Francis's cord belt casts a shadow on his habit, and his parted fingers on the ground behind his shoulder. The miracle - which has caused the wooden cross in the makeshift oratory to bleed and makes of Francis an 'alter Christus,' a second Christ - is felt throughout the natural world, a red sunset staining the Umbrian hills.",

The scene is divided unequally: the great disk of the sun - the only element of colour that stands out clearly from the more subdued tones of the clothes, flesh, and the greyish white background of the sky - is to the left of the central axis of the field, and the whole of the right part is dominated by the figure of the Creator who, surrounded by four children, moves impetuously toward the viewer.

It is however more probable that this work - which is also mentioned as being in the Medicean Villa at Careggi - was done in 1449-50 at Florence, because it derives its compositive formula from the Deposition by Fra Angelico which can be seen in the predella of the altarpiece of St Mark in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich. This painting, in a Renaissance frame decorated with pilasters, adorned the altar of the private chapel of the Medici villa in Careggi, near Florence. Cosimo de' Medici (1389 -1464) had built this country residence around the middle of the century, and there are good reasons to suppose that the Medici family, who must have owned Rogier's small panel of the Madonna (Städelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt), also commissioned the larger painting. The work closely follows the Entombment of Christ which was part of an altarpiece by Fra Angelico, painted around 1440 for the Florentine monastery church of San Marco. Its influence is evident in the display of the dead man, shown almost standing, with Mary and John holding his arms one on each side, and more particularly in the hill with the tomb in the rock, which runs entirely counter to Northern European tradition. Fra Angelico's altarpiece, to which the picture of the Entombment, much imitated in Florence, also belonged, was itself an important donation by the Medici family. It is improbable that Rogier van der Weyden saw Fra Angelico's work by chance on his Italian journey, and then reworked it for his own Medici altarpiece - particularly as we do not know whether he passed through Florence at all on his way to Rome. The model was more probably prescribed for him by his patrons when the work was commissioned. Very likely they sent the master a sketch of the work they had donated, telling him to follow it. Such clear guidelines from Florence would also explain why the painting was executed in almost square format, unusual for Netherlandish works but common in Italy and suitable for the architectural Renaissance setting. The patrons who commissioned the work will have been as much struck by the fine, realistic detail of the painting of the Lamentation as by the intense emotion of the faces. These qualities, and the slight asymmetry that suited late Gothic taste, distinguish the picture in significant respects from the work of Fra Angelico. A two-dimensionality at least matching that of the St John Altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), and not at all in line with the artistic ideals of the Renaissance, is particularly noticeable in the Magdalene kneeling at the front, her limbs compressed into the same plane. The painting can thus be associated with Rogier's late works coming after the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich).",

Caravaggio may have worked in haste to produce a picture before the feast of St Lucy on 13 December. His Sicilian biographer states that he owed the commission to his friend Minniti, who may also have helped him paint it. Originally Lucy's head was severed from her body but later Caravaggio joined it and left just a slit in the front of her neck - perhaps recalling St Cecilia, whose still-intact body, with a gash in the nape of the neck, had been sculpted in 1600 by Maderno. A more local influence was the crypt of the Syracusan church where Lucy had been buried, for cavernous spaces dwarf the human actors. The heavily-muscled grave-diggers emerge from murky shadows, the mourners are so much smaller that they seem placed some distance away, the officer directing operations beside the bishop is obscured and only the young man above the saint stands out poignantly in his red cloak. Characteristically, light imitates the action of the sun by falling from the right. The scene takes the viewer back to the age of the Church of the catacombs. The painting was recently restored at the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro in Rome (all Caravaggio's Sicilian paintings have come down to us in a poor state of preservation) and transferred from the Basilica di Santa Lucia al Sepolcro to the Bellomo Museum in Syracuse.",

        "description": "When the frescoes of Annibale Carracci on the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese were unveiled on June 2, 1601, one of those present was Pietro Aldobrandini, Clement VIII's nephew and Secretary of State. This is probably what led to a relationship between the cardinal and the Emilian painter, resulting in the former commissioning a painting entitled Domine quo vadis? (now in the National Gallery in London) from the artist the following year. He also asked him to decorate, between 1603 and 1604, six lunettes in his private chapel. This no longer exists, but at the time was located in what is today the private entrance to the apartment of Palazzo Doria Pamphilj al Corso. An old plan shows that it had three entrances and six walls of different sizes, two large, two middle-sized, and two small, on which the six lunettes were placed. The Flight into Egypt, one of the two biggest, was probably located on the wall in front of the altar, to the right of the entrance that led into what is now the Aldobrandini room. It is very likely that Annibale Carracci had made the designs for all six of the canvases, but when he fell ill in 1605, the commission passed to his assistant Francesco Albani, who received the first payment in that year. Shortly afterwards, on May 21 1606, Pietro Aldobrandini, who had fallen out with Paul V, left Rome and did not return until 1610. Meanwhile, the work proceeded under the supervision of Albani, who did not receive the final payment until 1613. The critics agree that only the Flight into Egypt and the Deposition are entirely the master's work, while the other four paintings - the Visitation, the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Assumption were painted by his collaborators Giovanni Lanfranco, Sisto Badalocchio, Domenichino, and Francesco Albani, though it is difficult to determine their individual contributions to the joint undertaking. The \"classical,\" composed, measured and ideal landscape of the Flight into Egypt, - one of the works that set the ground rules for seventeenth-century painting - spilled over, in harmony with the Aristotelian views of Agucchi, popular in Farnese-Aldobrandini circles, into the work of Poussin. Indeed its influence spread even further afield, to the German classicists Anton Koch and Philipp Hackert. The restful setting, the gently undulating planes that extend to the distant horizon, and even the boat - a symbol of life - floating on a peaceful river in the foreground create a most unusual atmosphere, based on the effect of repetition. This motif of the \"already seen\" and known, a constant feature of Italian landscape painting, from Carracci to Domenichino, from Viola to Grimaldi, and from Dughet to van Bloemen, always gives rise to a pleasing sense of familiarity.",

Esaias was born in Amsterdam in about 1590 and probably trained in the studio of Gillis van Coninxloo, an Antwerp landscape painter and follower of Pieter Bruegel the Elder; who had fled to the north as a Protestant refugee from the war in Flanders. Esaias van de Velde developed Coninxloo's style in the direction of greater realism. As can be seen in this small panel of 1623, his mature style is characterized by a striking naturalism created by free brushwork and a deliberately restricted palette. The mannerisms of Flemish landscape have disappeared to leave an image which conveys all the crispness of an icy winter day in Holland. The figures are sketched in sure, quick strokes, the landscape evoked in pigments thinly scraped across the still-visible gesso ground. Van de Velde also studied the work of Adam Elsheimer, the German painter who moved to Rome in the first decade of the seventeenth century. Esaias would have known Elsheimer's paintings in the form of prints and it is from them that he derives his low viewpoint and the triangular composition. At the same time as the powerful and naturalistic landscapes of Seghers and Esaias van de Velde were being created in Haarlem, Esaias's cousin, Jan van de Velde, was at work in the town engraving his delicate landscapes, and Cornelis Vroom was creating his understated but remarkably innovative paintings and prints based on the countryside around the town. Among Esaias's pupils was Jan van Goyen who was further to develop and refine his master's style.",

In the past the watch has been taken as a possible reference to the man's profession, but there can be little doubt that the timepiece (in a closed gold case) is a conventional vanitas motif. This reading is actually reinforced by the other instruments, whether or not they refer to a profession such as architecture or geography. In combination a square and dividers are attributes of Temperance, since they suggest proportion or moderation in worldly affairs (quite as that virtue's dominant attribute of a bridle indicates restraint).

        "description": "The subject is based on a moment in a romantic German novel entitled Undine, written by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, which was first translated into English in 1818 and became almost as popular with artists in England as Goethe's Faust. The incident painted by Maclise occurs in chapter IX, where the young knight, Huldbrand, accompanies his bride, Undine, back home through the forest. The priest, Father Heilmann, who has just performed the marriage ceremony, follows behind and is visible beneath the branch of the tree. Ahead is the dark and sinister apparition, Kuhleborn, the spirit of the waters and the uncle of Undine. Huldbrand draws his sword on Kuhleborn and then strikes him, whereupon the spirit of the waters is transformed into a waterfall. Clearly the painting illustrates the forces of good, represented by the newly married couple, overcoming the power of evil, symbolised by the looming figure of the water god. The narrative element of the picture is aligned on a diagonal, which is contained within a bower populated by elves, goblins and water-nymphs associated with the surrounding forest. The composition is a triumph of design with the main elements of the story formed by an ornamental border of considerable intricacy. Maclise used other such borders for several of his book illustrations including those for The Chimes by Charles Dickens of 1844 and Irish Melodies by Thomas Moore of 1845. Maclise has here relied on German sources for the decorative features, and was clearly influenced by German illustrators. Maclise was of Irish origin and in 1827 he came to London, where he almost immediately gained recognition as a portrait draughtsman, drawing numerous likenesses for Eraser's Magazine. He painted historical and literary subjects, several as frescoes for the Palace of Westminster. Maclise formed close friendships with the novelists Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray as well as his compatriot, the poet Thomas Moore, and the politician Benjamin Disraeli. With all of these he shared an ebullience of character and a sense of humour, but this later gave way to melancholy and pessimism.",

The only document referring to Goya's decorations is an account for materials, 'for the work in the chapel of San Antonio de la Florida, which he carried out at His Majesty's bidding in this year, 1798'. The account, dated 20 December, covers the period between June and October and includes the cost of a carriage to take Goya to and from the church every day from 1 August until the completion of the work. The decoration of the cupola, apse, lunettes and pendentives, executed in fresco with added touches of tempera, is unprecedented in Goya's oeuvre for the boldness and individuality of its style. The placing of the principal scene of the miracle on the walls of the cupola usually occupied by a representation of heaven is unconventional, like the decoration of the walls below with female angels and painted curtains. The effect of the whole is almost that of a secular decoration, strong in colour and free in handling. Many years after his burial in Bordeaux, Goya's remains were taken back to Spain and since 1929 they have been entombed in this church.",

X-ray examination reveals that the priming on all the additional pieces of canvas is identical, but differs from that of the central section of this work. It appears that the design on the initial piece of canvas had not been fully resolved in all respects by the time the extra portions were added. The join on the left is on a line with the tall windswept trees, which seem to have been painted over the sky and therefore may be regarded as an adaptation of the original design, which most probably incorporated a clear view through to the horizon. On the right the design has been more radically changed as a result of the addition. A steep bank (still visible to the naked eye) originally closed the composition, but this was painted out so that the horizon could be extended in the upper half and a further group of farm buildings introduced in the middle distance. The addition along the lower edge allowed for the horse and cart in the immediate foreground. In effect, if the additions are discounted, the original composition remains an entity in its own right, but the changes alter the dynamics of the painting, placing greater emphasis on the peasants wending their way to market. The composition of Summer is distinguished. There is an emphasis on contrasting diagonals that reinforces the sense of movement begun by the figures in the foreground. The eye is plunged into the distance across a glorious landscape that is positively pantheistic in its celebration of nature (note the cow being mounted in the centre of the composition). Regardless of differences in scale and style, a telling comparison can be made between Summer and The Flemish Fair by Jan Brueghel the Elder. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the composition of Summer depends upon a lost painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder entitled On the Way to Market, only known today through an anonymous drawn copy in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich.",

Lycurgus then explained to the mystified onlookers: 'These two dogs came from the same litter but they were raised in different ways. One has turned into glutton and the other a spirited hunting dog.' Lycurgus had trained one for the hunt and allowed the other to go its own way. The latter is the animal licking the pot in the foreground, while the hunting dog stands beside Lycurgus and receives an approving pat on the head. The hare it has caught lies on the step at Lycurgus' feet. At the time, the parable was cited in numerous tracts on education. In Everdingen's painting the scene is crystal clear and every detail is rendered with meticulous precision. And yet there is something unreal about it.

        "description": "In the beginning of the eighteenth century, this painting was in the guardaroba (cloakroom) of the Pitti Palace. From there, it moved to the Villa di Poggio a Caiano. It has been at the Uffizi since 1773. This is one of Dürer's later works, and can therefore be placed at the end of the period in which the artist journeyed tirelessly from one end of Europe to the other in the incessant search for new stimuli and new knowledge. An obvious reflection of it is the remarkable change that is visible in the treatment of the forms, which in this painting are round and fully sixteenth century and arranged in the space of the composition with absolute confidence, and the complex play of complementary curves created by the movement of the arms and hands of the Child. Dürer made the pear smaller as the painting process progressed. Despite its small scale, the Madonna is depicted in a half-bust; the child is seated, though it is unclear on what - maybe the mother's arm. The artist leaves that up to the spectator. It is the last and most stylistically mature version of the Madonna's image painted by Dürer. The image of Munich from 1516, though not revealing any emotional rapport between the mother and child, like this one, is nevertheless fascinating for its iconic aspect; but the Florentine image lacks intimate and formal tension. Here, too, the Madonna is frontally depicted, holding a pear in her left hand of which we see only the fingers. And here again, the long blond hair falls on her shoulders almost symmetrically to the right and left. The necklines of the white blouse and red dress are also nearly symmetrical, contrasting with her softly curved facial features. Her downward gaze shows meditation and pensiveness. Even the gaze of the clothed child is absorbed and immobile. The right hand holds on to the edge of the mother's cloak, and the left hand's fingers close around a nondescript flower. Evidently, this devotional image also was intended for meditation on the mother of God and on the Passion and Redemption of Christ, even if until now it has not been possible to discern any connection between the pear and the flower.",

As in Leonardo's picture, in Holbein's version the back wall is pierced by three windows, with the central window being reserved for the figure of Christ; the position of heads and arms also corresponds to Leonardo's composition. The dramatic interpretation likewise follows Leonardo's, the subject of the picture being the moment following Christ's announcement that He will soon be betrayed by one of them: as in the Leonardo, the apostles are animatedly discussing the shocking words Christ has just spoken. But, typically for Holbein, he does not adhere slavishly to the original; he alters the gestures and postures of the disciples, and also their faces. In addition, the eye is not led through the window openings to a distant landscape; Holbein encloses the shallow pictorial space by an intense blue sky that looks completely ethereal. The picture format is also more compact than Leonardo's, requiring a much more compressed arrangement of the figures. Jesus and his disciples sit at a narrow, covered table celebrating the Last Supper, but only nine of the twelve apostles are present. The three missing figures were possibly shown on the edges of the picture, which were lost when the panels were attacked in the iconoclastic riots of Reformation Basel, when the head of Christ was sawn out of the picture. The inventory of the Amerbach collection notes critically that the \"supper on wood\" was \"coarsely\" glued together.",

Following the path opened up by his uncle, he responded to the growing demand of a prosperous bourgeoisie that wished to decorate their houses with works that reflected the lay character of their surroundings, whilst retaining a moral and religious significance. Jesus' visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. Here the artist relegates the teaching of the divine word to the back of the painting, devoting the entire foreground to active life, incarnated by Martha, and in so doing juxtaposing a genre scene and a still-life. Like Aertsen, he assembles the domestic scene in his studio, drawing from a repertory of standard objects and utensils that he was to constantly reproduce elsewhere in various combinations. Again like Aertsen, he has borrowed from Serlio's treatise the Renaissance architecture in which he places his composition. However, it would be unfair to dismiss Beuckelaer as a mere follower. Rather the artist stands out by his extraordinary ability to reproduce textures in their full sensuousness, using a light and subtle stroke and a delicately gradated palette. With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier. A search for harmony guides him in the distribution of objects, colours, light and shade, in a careful composition that leaves nothing to chance. Multiplying the different levels of interpretation, the image moves beyond a simple illustration of the Gospel story to become a philosophical exegesis of visible reality. Invested with moral and symbolic content, each object reminds man of his carnal nature and warns him against the dangers of voluptuousness.",

They are seen on medieval fonts and as altarpiece cycles in early Netherlandish painting, where the subject seems to have had greater appeal, at least until the 17th century. The triptych of Rogier van der Weyden is a good example of these altarpieces. We see an acuteness of observation in the Altar of the Sacraments. The Calvary sequence takes place in the interior of a light, spacious church, whose carefully executed details immediately catch the viewer's eye. The seven sacraments are presented around the central crucifixion group accompanied by an angel with a banderole. The importance of the action in the central panel is emphasised by the size of the depicted personages compared to the figures in the side panels. The emotion of the central characters - Saint John and the three Marys - who are overcome with grief, is a characteristic feature of Van der Weyden's art. It is thought that the triptych was commissioned in 1441 by the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, for the altar of his private chapel. Van der Weyden portrays him on the left of the painting, as the bishop administering Confirmation. Van der Weyden was probably helped by his assistants during the execution of the Altar of the Sacraments.",

        "description": "Saint George and the Dragon symbolises the close relationship established between Rubens and the court of Charles I. The subject honours the patron saint of England and of the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III in 1348. The features of Saint George are traditionally stated to be those of Charles I, while the figure of the Empress Cleodelinde is, according to the same tradition, intended to be Queen Henrietta Maria. The verdant landscape is also a form of flattery in so far as it is inspired by the English countryside. Indeed, the background was described by Croft-Murray as 'probably Rubens's single essay in English landscape.' Some of the buildings are identifiable, although their contiguity is purely imaginary. On the left of the composition, for example, is the square church tower of St Mary Overy (now Southwark Cathedral) and to the right of this possibly the Banqueting House with Westminster Abbey before Hawksmoor's towers were added. Further down river on the right of the composition is an interpretation of Lambeth Palace. The canvas was extended by the artist, evidently sometime between 1630 and 1635. These additions betoken extensive rethinking of the design. The original concept was to have been contained within the central section and is recorded in a drawing in Stockholm (National Museum). This was preceded by a study in Berlin of motifs occurring in the right half of the composition. These drawings show that the horseman on the right was at first balanced on the left by a woman standing with a child, forms which can still be discerned between the trunks of the two trees and which are even more obvious by X-ray. They were omitted, however, when the composition was enlarged, possibly because they did not constitute a sufficiently strong counterpoint. The other elements of the composition, especially on the right, were merely rearranged on a broader scale. It is conceivable that some iconographical refinements were also made in order to sharpen the allegorical meaning. What remains of this central part is of good quality, particularly the flickering evening light and damp atmosphere so characteristic of the Thames Valley, and can be assigned to Rubens himself. The additions, however, are less adroitly handled and may have been left to studio assistants. The initial composition perhaps relates to the engraving of the same subject by Lucas van Leyden. The works of Pordenone, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Veronese and the Carracci family all inspired the artist in carrying out this political allegory which, in the context of the reign of Charles I, clearly has religious connotations with particular reference to Saint George.",

        "description": "Four large-scale decorative canvases emblematizing the 'Four Seasons' were commissioned around 1720 by Jean-François Leriget de la Faye (1764-1731), one of the most enlightened and distinguished patrons of the arts in Régence Paris. He was a diplomat, military man and connoisseur of art, music, ballet and theater, an amateur poet with enough merit to claim a seat in the Académie Française. By 1721, Watteau was dead and Lancret would have emerged as his undisputed successor as master of the fête galante. The commission would be the most important of Lancret's early career - indeed, one of the most important he would ever receive - coming as he was first establishing himself as an independent artist. Lancret's four paintings are wholly modern. With each canvas measuring c. 115 cm high and enlivened with a dozen or more figures, the artist represented each season of the year in lively scenes of contemporary city or country life, cloaked in fashionable dress and surroundings. The paintings are sparkling in execution, bright and richly coloured, and filled with carefully observed and often witty vignettes of men and women enjoying the pleasures of leisure time. The artist exemplified each season by its effect on human pleasure and merrymaking, showing the different forms of entertainment they offered: savouring grapes and wine in Autumn, bird catching in Spring, bathing in Summer, and playing cards by a cozy fire in Winter. Lancret's allegory of Winter depicts the everyday pleasures of upper-class society in early 18th-century France, set in a stately Régence interior. A group of figures are gathered in a refined drawing room; a fire lit in the background and fur-lined overgowns worn by the elegant ladies identify the season as winter. A card game is taking place at the table; some players are discussing strategy while others seem lost in thought, and the woman sitting at the center looks directly out at the viewer rather than at her hand. Two women nearby are reading a score while a third stands behind them, seemingly humming along. The young lady in the foreground entertains a kitten, while an older woman sits by the fire in the background, a small dog in her lap. In addition to its allegorical subject of Winter, the painting is one of the earliest known depictions of a Régence interior. In decorative arts, Régence was the transition style between Louis XIV's Baroque and Louis XV's Rococo.",

When it appeared, it immediately became one of Bellini's most celebrated works. The datation is uncertain, however, it is assumed that this was the first altarpiece by Bellini painted with the new oil technique introduced by Antonello da Messina in Venice in 1475-76. The altarpiece is one of the cornerstones of the artist's mature years. A coffered vault is a perspective introduction to the composition, which is supported at the sides by pillars similar to the real sculpted ones of the altar.

To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be raped, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide. Lucretia is portrayed at three-quarter length with the upper body bared to reveal her breasts spilling from precious fabrics and with jewellery draped across her naked skin. The female figure convey an immediate impression of beauty and luxury. Characteristic features include the head leaning reflectively to one side and the way in which the hands clasp the handle of the dagger.",

In Courbet's version, the artist depicted himself in the guise of a wandering Jew who meets his patron Bruyas, accompanied by his manservant on the road to Montpellier. Bruyas doffs his hat to the artist, and the servant stands with head respectfully lowered. In depicting himself thus, Courbet has referred to the changing status of the artist in the nineteenth century and has represented himself in a romantic role, as an essentially misunderstood, creative genius, working outside the norms of bourgeois society. It was to this aspect that Gauguin responded in this version, and the flavour of the original has been retained, although the composition and figures are markedly different. From his earliest self-portraits Gauguin had cast himself in the role of the artistic martyr and in 1889 this was to reach a climax in works like the Green Christ and Christ in the Garden of Olives.",

Shortly after 1661, the society moved to San Nicola de' Funari a Tor de' Specchi, which, following building work, was reconsecrated to SS. Ursula and Catherine of Alexandria. Until the mid-eighteenth century, Cavarozzi's painting probably hung not over the high altar, but above the altar at the left. The entire neighbourhood, including the church, was destroyed between 1928 and 1936 and at that time the painting was transferred to the sacristy of San Marco. Like Pomarancio's St Domitilla with SS. Nereus and Achilleus (Chiesa dei Santi Nereo e Achilleo, Rome), Cavarozzi based his work on Raphael's St Cecilia altarpiece in Bologna, which he probably knew from an engraving. This is especially apparent in the figure of St Catherine of Alexandria, who raises one leg and holds her hand to her breast as she gazes upwards at the triangle containing the all-seeing eye of God. Pope Ciriacus, too, looks heavenwards. Behind St Ursula are a number of her one thousand followers. In contrast to Pomarancio's St Domitilla, Cavarozzi's St Ursula looks towards the viewer with an outstretched arm, presenting the Banner of the Cross. The hand with the banner is modelled on the work of Michelangelo and has its roots in his Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo himself used the gesture again in his Risen Christ in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. The gesture is not only a call to imitate Christ and take up the cross, but also implies that only by doing so can one attain eternal life. Caravaggio, too, cited this gesture in his Calling of St Matthew in San Luigi dei Francesi. With outstretched hand and bent forefinger, Christ beckons Matthew to follow him. St Ursula's gesture has the same implication: only those willing to champion the cause of Christ and take up the Banner of the Cross in his defence can hope for salvation. Once again, Cavarozzi created a highly functional painting by adopting well-known gestures and poses, which helped viewers - in this case the members of the confraternity - to understand its meaning easily.",

Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole’s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm.

Although this portrait was later hung near Rudolf's tomb, there is no reference to his death in the inscription. That it may have been commissioned by Rudolf himself is further indicated by the fact that he is portrayed as an archduke {Archidux, as the Latin inscription reads), a rank which Rudolf unlawfully awarded himself. If the painting was indeed executed before 1365, it is the oldest autonomous portrait in the history of German art. It was admittedly intended less to capture an accurate likeness, however, than to reinforce Rudolf's political status. The shape of the bow evidently cites more or less exactly the bow in the crown of the Bohemian king Charles IV, whose daughter Catherine Rudolf married in 1357. The solidity of the areas of flesh contrasts abruptly with the treatment of the blonde hair and in particular the very two-dimensional portrayal of the serrated hat and the coat.",

Among his numerous theological writings was a defence of the 'perpetual virginity' of the Virgin Mary. His vision of the Virgin is represented in Spanish painting. It is related that he saw the Virgin with attendant angles seated on his episcopal throne in the cathedral. As he approached she threw over him a chasuble of heavenly origin. El Greco represent the patron saint of Toledo in full episcopal regalia, holding an elaborate gilt crosier through its green velvet sleeve wearing white kid gloves. He is wearing a spectacular chasuble  embroidered with floral arabesques and exotic birds, lined with pink silk, over a radiant white alb, and on his head an embroidered mitre. He reads a holy book with serious intensity while all around him the sky seems charged with high-voltage static. The saint is illuminated from the left, in contrast to the companion piece of St Peter, who is lit from the light. This, and the arched top of both canvases (reduced in both paintings) indicate that they were conceived to flank a window or central image. This was almost certainly The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. Thus St Peter would have been intended to hang to the left of the altarpiece and St Ildefonso to the right. It is unlikely that these paintings were ever hung in the chapel, having been substituted with copies from the start.",

The perfect regularity of her face as seen from the front leads one to think that, like the Self-Portrait with Fur Coat of 1500 of Munich, this has been \"reconstructed\" according to precise laws of proportion. The Madonna's gaze - her eyes reflecting, like her child's, the window beside them - is not turned toward the spectator, but is directed into the distance. Even the child has a fixed gaze and is busy with a pear in his little hands, while the Madonna gracefully holds a stem of a carnation, with fruit and flower, between her fingers. Similar to the Madonna, who, for the rigid, formal composition of the head seems distant, almost rapt in an ideal world, so the child, with his wide-open eyes, who seems detached from his mother and the spectator. The small panel assumes the look of an icon, in which the carnation alludes to the Passion, and the pear that the child closes in his hands recalls - according to Saint Bonaventure - the sweetness of the wise of mouth and heart.",

The scene is set in a room of the Bargello Palace, where the Duke, who had ruled despotically over Florence, is about to sign his resignation from government over the city. His expression matches the grim face of the perfidious councillor, Cerretieri Visdomini standing behind him, and also provides a contrast to the stationary attitudes of the characters on the left, identified as the figures behind the plot: Archbishop Acciaioli and representatives of the aristocracy and of the people. The ferment in the background culminates with the figure of the soldier on the right who, with his gestures, seems to urge the Duke to make this difficult choice, while through the window, it is possible to notice the celebrations already taking place in the city. The painting dates back to 1860 and was likely intended to commemorate the recent events of the liberation of Italy from oppressive foreign rule: first and foremost, the Austrian Empire. In fact, it was Tuscany that expelled its Grand Duke, Leopold II of Habsburg-Lorraine to join the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. This large canvas was a triumph at the 1861 National Exhibition in Florence, and at the 1867 Paris Exhibition, where it was awarded first prize and a gold medal respectively. The lengthy time for its creation can be seen in a series of preparatory drawings and a sketch. The theatrical setting of the scene, which is typical of the historic genre, has been enhanced by the identification of physiognomies and individual expressions. Presumably some of the artist's friends posed for the main figures in the painting and the figure of the armiger with the bandaged head is Ussi himself.",

This routine, which for other painters might have seemed mortifying, did nothing to extinguish the vivacious and brilliant vein of the artist. Dossi is always consistent. He flushes the flesh tones of his characters with orangy, reddish colours, he places them in risqué situations, with bare-chested women in convivial surroundings and almost obscene merrymaking men with such highly characterized faces that they are almost caricatures. The faces of the women and that of the faun are drawn directly from a cultured classical tradition which is inserted into the Mannerist context.

It is, in fact, a conflation of the Marian Pietà, in which the Virgin cradles her dead son in her lap, and the Trinity Pietà, in which God the Father holds the recently crucified Christ before him. It is an emblematic representation intended as the object of meditation rather than the portrayal of an episode from the Gospels. Similarly, the Arma Christi in the background should be interpreted as signs of the Passion. Several emblems are included, in addition to obvious attributes such as the Cross, on which hangs the dark-purple robe from Christ's Mockery; the post from the flagellation with its rope, rods and flails; the cane and sponge, the spear, the hammer and nails. Looking from top to bottom, we see: on the left, Peter with Caiaphas' servant-girl, Judas with the purse around his neck, Annas and Caiaphas, the hand which struck Jesus, the fist that punched him, and another hand with closed fingers; on the right, Pilate and Herod, a hand making the obscene fica gesture, a head in profile (customarily one of the soldiers who mocked or spat at Christ), a hand that has pulled out some of Jesus' hair, and a stamping foot. Apart from a few copies, there is one larger version that is worthy of particular note (Granada, Capilla Real). This might be a copy of a second version of the same theme, also designed by Memling. A third Memling Man of Sorrows is also known, in which the figure of Christ makes the same gesture with his right arm as the Granada type. It is assumed that the painting belonged to a triptych. It has been established with near certainty that the Angel with a sword in London's Wallace Collection is the right wing of this triptych, and that the recently discovered Angel with an olive branch in the Louvre is a fragment of the left wing. The date on the column capital is no longer clearly legible. The last numeral is particularly badly abraded, which gave rise to a variety of readings in the past.",

They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm. The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm.",

(The other two are Sts Francis and Lucy.) The figures, posed naturally and at ease, create a \"sacra conversazione\" (holy conversation), a reinterpretation of the traditional theme of the Madonna and Child surrounded by saints depicted in Gothic polyptychs which became widely used in the fifteenth century as square or rectangular altarpieces became more common. The step of the dais where the Virgin Mary sits is signed by Domenico Veneziano, one of the greatest interpreters and innovators of the Florentine Renaissance, although records have always referred to the master painter as a native of Venice. The artist demonstrates his mastery of linear perspective with a central vanishing point conceived by Filippo Brunelleschi; the clear light entering from the right enhances the chromatic range of predominantly light tones and refines the shapes of the bodies, while their shadows cast on the floor are perfectly proportioned. The purity of the skin tones and the idealized beauty of the figures of the Madonna and Child and Saint Lucy - the latter holding a dish bearing her eyes which were gouged out during her martyrdom - contrast with the amber tones and worn faces of the three saints, respecting the iconographic models and aesthetic canons in vogue during the 15th century. The setting features certain elements still attributable to the Gothic tradition, such as the pointed arches of the colonnade. Originally displayed on the high altar of the church of Santa Lucia de' Magnoli in Florence, the painting has since been separated from its frame and predella (currently shared between the National Gallery in Washington, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin) which depicts the Annunciation and Four Scenes from the Lives of the Saints.",

In the left part of the panel, Lucretia is bloodless, with the knife in her chest, supported by her husband's embrace, while in the centre she is laid out on a catafalque for her funeral. The scene is set out of doors, in front of a column topped by the naked statue of an armed youth of uncertain identity. Among the crowd in the centre, Lucius Junius Brutus is approaching. Together with Lucretia's family, he will be seeking revenge for the woman, inciting the people of Rome to rise up, overthrow the king and proclaim the Republic. The subject illustrated, which praises the chasteness of Lucretia, was widely used to decorate the nuptial bedrooms in Florentine palaces of the 15th century, where there would be painted coffers, beds and bedposts. The panel painted by Filippino Lippi was part of one of these decorations and was combined with another panel - also by Lippi - showing the story of another Roman heroine, Virginia (now in the Louvre). The painting of Lucretia's death is a youthful work by Filippino Lippi and perhaps in terms of the composition it was inspired by the work of his master, Sandro Botticelli.

        "description": "The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu. They were intended for a room in his château in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling. The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's château celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering décor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye. Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus. The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus. A world of pagan imaginings is brought to life in all its cruel and seductive charm, without a hint of anachronistic moralising.",

She was the mother of Christian V. In spite of the dire financial situation of the Kingdom, she was the centre of a sumptuous court life, with exclusive luxury items and grand parties, which shed glory on the royal power. The present painting belongs to the group of around 100 pictures, studies, and sculptures that Zahrtmann created on the basis of Leonora Christine's (1621-1698) memoirs from 1869. Her life and destiny, spanning the range from wealth and power through imprisonment and shame to rehabilitation and release, fascinated Zahrtmann for almost 50 years. Sophie Amalie was behind Leonora Christine's arrest and 22 years of imprisonment in Blatarn. Zahrtmann hated her for that, and his sentiments are apparent with exceptional honesty in this depiction of her death throes. Surrounded by silverware and magnificent silks, the dowager queen Sophie Amalie breathes her last. A grotesque figure whose status and wealth cannot deliver her from a violent and painful death by asphyxiation.",

The composition with two scenes depicting the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi is rather sophisticated. The placement of the walls at an angle and the use of this background two divide the two scenes; the alternation of figures in frontal and profile view; and the contrast  of fully lit and penumbral areas attest to a strict spatial logic deployed to create a unified stage setting. The imposing wall is rendered with an obsession for architectural detail and measured by the grid formed by the scaffolding holes. Breaches in the wall enliven the scene by providing views onto the landscape, while elsewhere the wall remains intact and serves as backdrop for the figures. Although this type of background was inspired by Fra Angelico's Adoration of the Magi, its figurative weight anticipates Baldovinetti's Nativity in the Santissima Annunziata and the later paintings of the Nativity by Fra Filippo Lippi in Spoleto and Fra Diamante.",

The large-size altarpiece with outer wings hinged (which this panel belongs to) was made in collaboration by the two brothers Hans the Younger and Ivo Strigel. Ivo (b. 1430, Memmingen, d. 1516, Memmingen) painted altarpieces like his brother Hans II, and supplied them as far afield as Lake Constance, the Grisons and the Tyrol. He was variously referred to as a painter or sculptor, but the evidence gives no clear picture of the range or exact nature of his activities. The panel is a wing of the polyptych, which explains the grouping of the figures. Though these appear against a golden background decorated with a vigorously winding floral pattern, they stand on firm, realistic ground, bringing the group into a distant relationship with the Italian 'sacra conversazione'. The basic colours of the three figures' garments - black, crimson and green - melt into a tonal unity rarely encountered in German panels. The attribute of Florian, a house in flames, is much larger than the usual toy-like size of similar earlier representations, having started on the course from a symbol to a real object with a life of its own. It was evidently to counterbalance this increased volume that the artist decided to paint this saint's legs in tights which make the silhouette look slimmer, while the other two are covered by wide cloaks reaching to the ground.",

Replicas of the two pictures, painted in a smaller format but from his own hand, came also to the Gemäldegalerie in 1778. The panorama of the city, shown in this picture, was to become the classic view of Dresden, seen approximately from the level of the Japanische Palais: the right-hand side of the painting is dominated by the Catholic Hofkirche, shining in its light shades and intensified by its reflection in the river. Although the tower had not yet been finished, Bellotto faked it after inspecting the architect's plans. Behind the Hofkirche we see parts of the royal residence, including the lofty Hausmannsturm, which seems to rest on the roof of the Hofkirche. The Augustusbrücke as designed by Matthias Daniel Poppelmann sweeps across the Elbe, and acts as it were as the plinth for the buildings that form the Brühlsche Terrasse behind: the palace of Anton Egon von Fiirstenberg, who ruled Dresden whenever Augustus the Strong was away in Poland, followed by the Palais Brühl with its tall windows in the form of semicircular arches, and then the Brühlsche Bibliothek and the Gemäldegalerie of Count Brühl, Prime Minister to Augustus III. Rising up directly behind them is the majestic dome of the Protestant Frauenkirche, designed by George Bahr, newly built but already an integral part of Dresden's skyline. The precision of Bellotto's vedute makes it easy to forget their carefully calculated compositions. The way the river forms a diagonal, or the bank in the foreground a wedge shape, or the building on the far left acts as a link between picture and frame: all accord with specific rules and conventions that developed from landscape painting. Bellotto adds a number of incidental figures, most strikingly an impoverished family at the front left who have settled outside a simple wooden hut.",

        "description": "The picture shows the general view toward the interior walls of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori in the Abbey of Santa Maria, Grottaferrata. The Exarchic Monastery of Santa Maria in Grottaferrata, also known as the Greek Abbey of Saint Nilus, was founded in 1004 by a group of monks from Calabria led by St Nilus of Rossano, a charismatic leader and a very important figure of his time. When St Nilus, the monks' spiritual father, died shortly after founding the Abbey, St Bartholomew the Younger, his favourite disciple and cofounder of the monastery, assumed their leadership. Today, Grottaferrata is the last of the many Byzantine-Greek monasteries that dotted Sicily, southern Italy and Rome itself in the Middle Ages. It is also unique in that, having been founded fifty years before the Great Schism that divided Catholics and Orthodox, it remained in communion with the Church of Rome while preserving the Byzantine rite and monastic tradition of its founders. Preceding the modernization in the style of the Roman Baroque, a chapel, connected to the church and consecrated by the abbey's two founders, had been remodeled between 1608 and 1610. The redesign was funded by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese who commissioned Domenichino to decorate the chapel. The commission was completed in 1612. Domenichino was responsible for the design of painted architecture which structures the simple space of the chapel primarily by painterly means. The elegant row of columns between the chapel and the chancel creates a caesura in terms of subject matter. The paintings in the spandrels flanking the choir arch depict the Annunciation. Between the columns one can see into the chancel, the centre of which is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels. By contrast to the scenes related to the Salvation, the narrative paintings on the long walls of the main space are devoted to the two founders of the abbey; because of their size and viewing angles they are the chief attractions of the ensemble. The long walls are divided into two stories, each divided by a door into two rectangular spaces of different width. The events from the lives of the two founders are presented in a total of seven scenes. The scenes selected from various sources meant to illustrate the joint activities of the two founding saints. Three scenes are in the chancel, and four on the long walls of the main room. In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.",

Considered one of the best landscape painters of his time, he worked for a series of important patrons, including Popes Gregory XIII, Sixtus V and Clement VII, and Cardinals Scipio Borghese and Federico Borromeo, also the protector of Jan \"Velvet\" Brueghel. The prestige Bril enjoyed is also attested by his titles of Principe (1620) and of Secondo Consigliere (1623), attributed for the first time to a landscape painter and to a foreigner by the highly reputed Accademia di San Luca. Bril's seascapes, easel paintings of his mature period, are among his most innovative paintings. Among them this Port, whilst retaining the elevated vantage point typical of the Flemish tradition, offers a unified vision of space of rare amplitude. The composition is no longer based on divergent planes, but is constructed on perspective lines that start from the left and converge towards a vanishing point on the far right-hand horizon. This focal point is also the source of an intense light which, reflecting on the tranquil water, confers a particular serenity to the work. It is the end of the day: in the foreground, sailors and boats are silhouetted against this sunset that is so typical of the Mediterranean. However, this is an imaginary bay, in an idyllic evocation of the open sea. Indeed it is unlikely that vessels of the size of a caravel would moor against such a rocky shore. It has also been observed that the masts are too high and the bowspit too long. But it is precisely these verticals, against the clear sky and sea, that give the painting its balance. With their perfect synthesis of Flemish and Italian elements, Bril's seascapes deeply impressed his contemporaries. Papal superintendent Giovan Battista Crescenzi, as well as Federico Borromeo, Scipio Borghese and Carlo de' Medici all commissioned port views from the artist. These views were also to strongly influence several generations of painters, among them Claude Lorrain, a drawing of whose, taken from his famous Liber Veritatis and conserved at the British Museum in London, closely follows the Brussels seascape. This grand master of French landscape painting was, moreover, the pupil of Agostino Tassi, who himself learned his trade from Paul Bril.",

In this scene Mantegna combines portraiture, the almost archaeological reconstruction of an ancient city, and a highly-specified, convincing landscape. The scene is interpreted as the chance encounter between Ludovico Gonzaga and his son, Cardinal Francesco. The painting also can be seen as a presentation of three generations in the male line of the Gonzaga. The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The line of succession is assured, with a division of power in each generation between those selected for secular career and those called to a life in the Church. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope.",

These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. In Italy, pictures like this, which appear to be carved in stone, were first seen in the bases of Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, where he illustrated the seven Virtues and seven Vices. At the end of the 15th century, grisaille work was in great demand, and Mantegna painted a number of pictures in this technique. The present painting was one of a series of four long, narrow paintings ordered from Mantegna by Francesco Cornaro at the beginning of 1505. Mantegna was able to complete only this painting before his death. However, sketches for the others still exist and the rest of the series was completed on this basis, in Venice; among these is the Continence of Scipio by Giovanni Bellini. At the end of the second Punic War, a Sybilline oracle predicted that a Roman victory would be hastened if they brought the foreign goddess Cybele to Rome. So in 204 BC, the Roman Senate decided that as the most distinguished of all the Romans, the still youthful patrician Publius Cornelius Scipio (235-183 BC) should receive the goddess and give her shelter in his house until a temple had been built. From the left of the painting the priests in their flowing robes are approaching with a bust of Cybele. A young follower falls on his knees in reverence, his position in the centre of the picture emphasizing the unusually wide format of this work. Scipio leads out the group of Romans who have been awaiting the arrival of this image of the goddess, which has been brought fromAsia Minor.",

Painted for the 14th Secession exhibition (1902), the frieze was intended as part of the group's homage to the Leipzig artist Max Klinger, whose polychrome sculpture, the Beethoven Monument (Museum der Bildenden Künste, Leipzig), formed the centrepiece of the show. The centre wall (The Hostile Powers, the Titan Typhoeus, the Three Gorgons) was conceived as a pictorial paraphrase of the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and depicted the struggle for happiness undertaken by a knight in armour who, vanquishing the 'hostile powers' (the giant Typhon, the three Gorgons, disease, insanity and death), leads 'weak humanity' into the realm of the arts. The left longitudinal wall shows female figures gliding along horizontally. This part of the frieze is referred to in the Beethoven exhibition catalogue as \"Die Sehnsucht nach dem Glück\" (The Longing for Happiness). An upright nude woman and a similarly nude kneeling couple are the first figures that the floating figures meet. According to the exhibition catalogue, these three figures symbolize \"Die Leiden der schwachen Menschheit\" (The Suffering of Weak Mankind). The \"Suffering of Weak Mankind\" group turns pleadingly towards a knight, the \"Wohlgerüsteten Starken\" (Knight in Shining Armor), who stands before them. Behind the golden knight appear two allegorical female characters, who are referred to in the catalogue as \"Ehrgeiz\" (Ambition)\" and \"Mitleid\" (Compassion). On the right longitudinal wall, the \"Sehnsüchte und Wünsche der Menschheit\" (Longings and Desires of Mankind) return as a horizontal floating procession and move on until they are stopped by the lonely figure of \"Poetry\". On the final section of this wall, a vertical group of crouching women, called \"Die Künste\" (The Arts), reach from floor to ceiling like a living pillar. It leads to the \"Chor der Paradiesesengel\" (Choir of Angels from Paradise), which corresponds to Beethoven's closing chorus of Schiller's \"Ode an die Freude\" (Ode to Joy). In the exhibition catalogue, Klimt's female choir is characterized as follows: \"The arts lead us into the ideal kingdom, which is the only place we can find pure joy, pure happiness, and pure love. ' Joy, thy purest spark divine, this kiss to all the world'.\" His pictorial representation of the \"kiss to all the world\" manifests itself in the form of an embracing naked couple, which also signals the climax and finale of the frieze. The Beethoven Frieze is on permanent display in the Vienna Secession Building in a specially built, climate-controlled basement room.

They attended the school of Léon Bonnat, or the Académie Julian, or the Académie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Léon Gérôme. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grèz-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods. In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new. Anna Ancher was a mistress of interior light and colour. She generally used her effects to establish a quiet, contemplative mood. The sensitivity and gifted colourism of her paintings created soulful, intimate atmospheres. In the present canvas, she uses the contrast of sunlight and the silhouettes of potted plants and window crossbars on the wall and floor. Her colour scheme is based on the contrasting blue of the wall and upholstery and the yellow of the curtains, an effect that is replicated in the blue smock and blonde hair of the girl sitting by the window.",

        "description": "Huguet is an exemplary representative of Catalan painting of the 15th century, which remained indebted to medieval tradition and almost untouched by the innovations of the Early Renaissance. There are no records documenting his work before the year 1448, when he was commissioned to paint a St James altar for Arbeca. Between then and 1486, he executed a lengthy series of polyptychs, of which his Saints Abdon and Sennen Altar (1458-1460) and Three Kings altar (Barcelona, Museo de Historia de la Ciudad, 1464) stand out in particular. Huguet's painting underwent no notable stylistic development. He generally stuck to a gold background; spatial details were kept to a minimum, and the two-dimensional plane prevailed over physical volume. Huguet was so busy that he gradually employed more and more assistants in his workshop, which resulted in his works deteriorating in technical quality and becoming somewhat hackneyed in their appearance. Jaume Huguet's best-preserved work is his Saints Abdon and Sennen Altar, executed for St Peter's church in Terrassa, near Barcelona. This detail shows the main picture, featuring the standing figures of the two martyrs of late antiquity. Although today relatively unknown, in Huguet's day they were highly revered by Catalan farmers. Their story was also included in the most famous medieval collection of biographies of saints, the Golden Legend. Huguet portrays the two martyrs dressed in the style of nobles of his day. The crowns which they wear on top of their fashionable hats indicate their royal rank. In their hands they carry the instruments of their martyrdom. Tall, slender, almost boringly well-proportioned figures, with gentle faces and even features, were one of the painter's hallmarks. In a similar fashion to Cologne, Catalonia continued to employ lavish gold grounds far longer than in the Netherlands. In the present example, Huguet has even tooled a tendril pattern into parts of the gilding, while introducing raised relief into the crowns, haloes and decorative details.",

The use of pastel allowed Manet great contrasts of texture and colour, giving the picture an intensity and bloom that oil on canvas could not match. It was a medium to which Manet often returned, and his superlative technique resulted in numerous masterpieces. The apogee of the pastel was the eighteenth century, and it had been relatively little practiced since, confined, for the most part, to landscape, in the work of Boudin, Delacroix, and Millet. Manet adopted it under the prompting of Degas, who had made a number of successful pastel portraits.",

        "description": "Matthias Corvinus (1443-1490), also called the Just in folk tales, was King of Hungary (as Matthias I) and Croatia from 1458, at the age of 14 until his death. After conducting several military campaigns he became also King of Bohemia (1469-1490), and Duke of Austria (1486-1490). With his patronage Hungary became the first European country which adopted the Renaissance from Italy. As a Renaissance ruler, he established education institutions, patronized art and science, and introduced a new legal system in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the era of his kingship, Matthias strongly endeavoured to follow the model and ideas of the philosopher-king as described in Plato’s Republic. The Matthias Fountain is a monumental fountain group in the western forecourt of Buda Castle, Budapest. It is a Neo-Baroque work by Alajos Stróbl. The group depicts a hunting party led by Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. The bronze figures are standing on heaps of rocks against the backdrop of the northern façade of the former Castle Church. Water is running down between the cracks of the boulders. The whole theatrical arrangement bears resemblance to the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome although it is on a much smaller scale. The monumental facade behind the fountain is flanked by two pairs of giant Corinthian columns. The original balustrade crowning and the Mansard roof was richer in details but it was simplified after the second world war. The central niche forms a triumphal arch which is decorated with King Matthias' personal coat of arms. King Matthias is standing on the highest rock in hunting attire. He is holding a crossbow in his right and a huge stag lies dead at his feet. On the lower rocks a henchman blows his horn and the leader of the hunting group rests sitting on a boulder with his back towards the viewer. Three hounds complete the central group. There are two more bronze figures on the sides of the basin. They are connected to the central group with gestures and gazes but they have their own plinths. On the right is Szép Ilonka (Helen the Fair), heroine of a famous 19th century ballad by Mihály Vörösmarty. The girl is looking towards the king protecting her tame fawn from the hunters. On the right is the Italian chronicler, Galeotto Marzio who lived in King Matthias court. A dog lies at his feet and a falcon sits on his arm.",

In this early painting, which has suffered from weathering, Rosso already expresses his own unconventional interpretations.

He represented the Virgin ascending dramatically upwards into the golden firmament on lavender-coloured clouds with a chorus of angels at her feet. This daringly foreshortened, angled ring of naked children is surprisingly accomplished. Certain angels are seen in the same pose but shifted round, suggesting that Rosso painstakingly studied them first from purpose-made sculptural models in the studio.",

He also worked in Rome (1524—27), where he painted The Vision of Saint Jerome (London, National Gallery), and at the end of his life in Casalmaggiore, where he was exiled for failing to complete the decorations in Santa Maria della Stec- cata begun in 1534. Pallas Athene would appear to be a late work and is comparable in style with Parmigianino's last altarpiece, The Virgin and Child with Saint Stephen and Saint John the Baptist (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen), painted for the church of San Stefano in Casalmaggiore in 1539-40. The gracefulness of the style evolved for the so-called 'Madonna with the Long Neck' of around 1535 (Florence, Uffizi) gives way to a greater sense of gravity in these late works, characterised by slower, more ponderous rhythms and simpler compositions. The warm flesh tones and the drapery that resembles thin sheets of beaten metal are also hallmarks of the artiste late style, although the elegant turn of the head, the etiolated fingers and the delicate treatment of the highlighted strands of hair evoke the earlier, more poetic style. The appearance of Pallas Athene complies with Ovid's description in his Metamorphoses VI. The figure wears armour but lacks the helmet and spear, perhaps because the artist chose to emphasise the association with wisdom and the arts as opposed to more warlike aspects. The plaque indicated by the hand is reminiscent of an antique cameo, but it is not a copy. The depiction of the city and the winged figure of Victory flying with a palm and an olive branch are references to Pallas Athene's success over Poseidon concerning the ownership of Attica, of which Athens was the capital.",

He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators. In the present painting the figures are grouped in the lower right-hand corner, cut off by the corner of the frame. The composition is similar to that of the earlier At the Races in the Countryside, but the emphasis on realistic drawing, which is evident in the earlier work, is replaced here by an arrangement of broad patches of colour. Degas is still attracted by the nervous elegance and disciplined dancing grace of the horses, but everything is blended in a harmony of colours, which turns the canvas into a mosaic.",

        "description": "Between 1542 and 1548 Pope Paul III transformed a series of rooms on the two upper levels of the Castel Sant'Angelo into a comfortable and at the same time impressive apartment. Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments. The largest room of these apartments, the great hall today called the Sala Paolina after the pope who commissioned it, surprises the visitor with its festive exuberance. Most important is the impression of the whole which presents itself to the eye and aims to overpower visitors to the room with the sheer display of riches, splendour, and bounty. This impression is the  result of the decorative system designed by Perino del Vaga. The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with \"living\" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings. The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III). Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault. 1. Alexander the Great before the High Priest  2. Alexander the Great in the Temple of Jerusalem  3. Alexander the Great Burns His Own Train  4. Alexander the Great Battles the Indian King Porus  5. Alexander the Great Has Ships Built  6. Alexander the Great's Entry into Babylon. The picture shows the first scene of the Alexander cycle, which starts on the vault above the Archangel Michael: Alexander the Great before the High Priest. The scene depicts Alexander the Great meeting the high priest of Israel before the gates of Jerusalem. This ancient event served to illustrate the supremacy of ecclesiastical over secular authority. The theme of the subordination of secular rulers to spiritual authority was naturally suited to papal residences.",

Instead of Marsyas's own instrument, the Phrygian double recorder, a syrinx or shepherd's pipe appears in the second picture in front of King Midas. He deemed its music superior to the sound of Apollo's divine instrument and was punished by growing ass's ears. The pagan flutist, however, received harsher punishment: the majestic but merciless young god is preparing to have him flayed. The landscape background with clear blue sky in both paintings evokes the world of myths, in which the happiness and cruel justice of the eternal gods coexist for the edification of the observer. Thus in this artistic conception the elements of Apollo's two musical duels are present and are even intermingled. It seems the painter did not adhere to the Ovidian source.

On the pilaster dividing the two parts of the room are Isaiah above and a youthful David as the conqueror of Goliath below. On the vault of the front section of the room are depictions of the four cardinal virtues, while on the rear section are the three theological virtues and Humilitas.

In 1540, soon after marrying Eleonora of Toledo, Cosimo de' Medici moved from the Palazzo Medici into the Palazzo della Signoria, publicly proclaiming his dominance over all civic institutions. Cosimo remodeled the building to accommodate his expanding family and commissioned elaborate decorative programs of the histories of his ancestors, of his own military conquests, and of dynastic portraiture to fill its vast spaces. On the upper floor Cosimo constructed a small cubical chapel for Eleanor's private devotions, completely decorated by Bronzino with imagery that ostensibly referred to Christian redemption but which barely veiled his dynastic and political intentions. The wall frescoes all depict scenes from the life of Moses: the left-wall frescoes include the Miracle of the Spring (Moses Striking the Rock) and the Gathering of Manna, the right wall is covered by the fresco Crossing of the Red Sea, an uncommon subject in Christian chapels. The altarpiece currently in the chapel, depicting the Lamentation, is a replica Bronzino made in 1553 of his 1545 original (which was sent to France as a diplomatic gift and is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon). Bronzino also removed the original flanking panels of St John the Baptist and St Cosmas and replaced them with side panels depicting the Annunciation. The frescoes of the vault represents Sts Michael, John the Evangelist, Jerome and Francis. For the decoration of the chapel Bronzino applied an unusual technique: the underpainting was true fresco and the finished layer in tempera. The combination of complex figural compositions, rich colours, and elaborate decorative motifs within the chapel's small space create a bejewelled effect typical of Mannerism as practiced at the court of Cosimo and Eleonora. The style employed by Bronzino in the chapel frescoes resembles the cool, calculated manner which can be seen in his portraits.",

        "description": "The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezières, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities. The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them: we notice immediately the basic difference between the archaic choice of images, sometimes portrayed purely as a sort of inventory, offered by the older artists and the new, lively depictions of the city painted by Carpaccio. Gentile Bellini painted three of the teleri, the second being the Miracle of the Cross recovered from the canal of S. Lorenzo. According to legend the miraculous event took place between 1370 and 1382 during the annual procession when the relic of the Holy Cross was carried from the Scuola to the church of San Lorenzo. When the procession was crossing the bridge in front of the church of S. Lorenzo the relic was pushed into the waters of the canal by the crowd. The relic floated, miraculously eluding the grasp of all the faithful who dived into the canal to save it; all except Andrea Vendramin, the Grand Guardian of the Scuola. The scene is registered with documentary fidelity but is seen as though through a watery light. The same rarified atmosphere overlays both participant in the event and the spectators of the miracle who include real contemporary figures: Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, is the first of the ladies kneeling on the stage on the left, and in the group of gentlemen on the right Gentile included portraits of himself and his brother Giovanni. Incomparable fifteenth century Venice then, with its buildings decorated with highly coloured frescoes and painted plaster work, with its round chimney-pots and equally characteristic jutting grills, provides a colourful and poetically archaic setting for the event. And the many characters who people the picture seem to be participants in a scene of enchantment, inhabiting a magically still atmosphere, figures set in relief against the deep green of the waters of the canal frozen forever in this moment of time.",

A cameo is suspended from the string of pearls on her belt. St Mary Magdalen, the patron saint, holds her vase of ointment in her left hand and points with the right to the lady, kneeling in an attitude of prayer. The yellow silk cap of the saint is adorned with ropes of pearls, the sleeves of her bodice are blue, the bodice itself of red-blue brocade, and the mantle green. The Magdalen's features are finely drawn, with delicate nose and lips; both of the women's faces are painted in a portrait technique, the donor's being more strongly characterized. The painter's gift for portraiture is excellently displayed in this picture and so is his sense of lucid and harmonious composition and his feeling for colour. It is assumed that the donor is Madeleine de Bourgogne",

In the picture on the right he is preaching, and in the next picture he is baptizing Christ. The same landscape is continued through both scenes, linking them to one another. The sixth scene of the cycle depicts the  Baptism of Christ. This story shows, \"... his reverential attitude displaying the belief which he had in that sacrament, and... he represented a crowd of naked and bare-footed figures waiting to be baptised, their faces displaying faith and desire, one especially who is taking off his shoe being energy itself\" (Vasari). The Baptism of Christ is an emulation of the painting by Verrocchio and Leonardo in the Uffizi, though the angels and landscape are far weaker. There is a very old-fashioned feeling about the depiction of God the Father, who is giving His blessing surrounded by angels. In this painting the artist was interested less in depicting the baptism than in displaying variation of the nude figure. These were inspired both by Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel and also by classical sculpture. As early as the 1440s, in Piero della Francesca's Baptism of Christ, a magnificent nude figure had been depicted in the act of undressing. Piero's arrangement of the main figures also influenced of the version of the Baptism by Verrocchio and Leonardo.",

        "description": "The history of Lot is taken from Genesis (19. 1-38). When the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were about to be destroyed at God's order, angels came and warned Lot to flee with his family. Despite being warned not to, his wife looked back at the burning city of Sodom and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot and his daughters then took refuge in a cave. Afraid of finding themselves alone on earth and without descendants, Lot's daughters decided to get their father drunk and to seduce him. This latter episode forms the main theme of the painting. At the centre of the composition, the elder sister, half naked, is seated on the knees of the old man Lot. Alongside them, the younger sister gracefully proffers a cup of wine. To the left, Sodom is in flames, whilst the angels are helping Lot and his family to escape; to the right, Gomorrah also is in flames, and facing us, a little city has escaped the disaster. This is probably Zoar, where the family had first taken refuge. Old Testament subjects, until then considered essentially as prefigurations of the New Testament, enjoyed an unprecedented success in the 16th century, in particular as the Reformation encouraged the direct reading of the Bible. In the moral literature of the time, the story of Lot and his daughters served primarily to illustrate the pernicious power of women and the disastrous consequences of drunkenness (according to the Bible, Lot was unaware of anything). The subject matter also furnished an example of unequally aged couples, a fashionable theme at the time. In the picture, the incestuous act is symbolised by the lizard, an impure animal, in the lower left-hand corner. Similarly, the fruit that the younger sister is carrying in her laps evokes desire. The slim, well-figured shapes of the young women, their milky-coloured skins and their languid gestures give off, however, a latent eroticism which is not unambiguous. The work was undoubtedly intended for a private residence. Here Jan Massys reaches the peak of his art. The elegance of the poses and the pronounced taste for sophisticated jewellery and hairdresses reveal the influence of the Fontainebleau school where the artist possibly lived, after being banished from Antwerp (1544-55) under suspicion of sympathising with the Reform movement. The painter was to handle the theme two other times, in particular in paintings conserved at Vienna (dated 1563) and at Cognac.",

That Caroline was a positive influence on the artist, which is evidenced by the fact that, from this point on, women appear with greater frequency in his work. A new, friendly element seems to enter his pictures. A case in point is the painting to which some authors give the title Woman before the Rising Sun, and which others call Woman before the Setting Sun. The woman seen in rear view appears as a large silhouette against the intense reddish-yellow of the sky. It is difficult to interpret the fervent gesture of her outstretched arms and the stylised rays radiating from the mountains on the hazy horizon, heralding the presence of the invisible sun. Caroline was probably the model for the female figure in old-German dress. Since she is stepping towards the light like an early Christian in prayer, some have sought to interpret the painting in terms of a communion with nature. On the other hand, the atmosphere evoked in Friedrich's painting might be interpreted as that of dusk, the path which terminates so abruptly as an announcement of death, and the boulders scattered alongside the path as symbols of faith. In the final analysis, few of Friedrich's pictures are as emphatic and almost exaggeratedly symbolic in their effect - factors which render the painting not unproblematic for the viewer.",

His decision to use the approach of Caravaggio may have something to do with the choice of subject matter, contrasting the humility of human existence and the possibilities of costume as disguise - a concept formulated by Caravaggio in his paintings for San Luigi and frequently taken up by his followers. Guercino does not portray the return of the prodigal son as a scene of recognition or joy, choosing instead to depict a more tranquil motif from the biblical parable - the moment when he is given fine robes to wear. On the left in the painting, the young man has stood up and is removing the rags of the swineherd, while an old man, presumably his father, places a hand on his shoulder and takes a clean shirt from the other, foppishly dressed young man who is holding new clothes over his outstretched arm and new shoes in his hand. By using light and shade to divide the group, Guercino lends a singular autonomy to the dynamics of the outstretched and grasping hands, thereby intensifying the narrative in a most unusual way. This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Giacomo Serra, the papal legate to Ferrara.",

In 1811 they became engaged, but Maria's father, Solicitor to the Admiralty, and especially her grandfather the rector, opposed her union to 'a man below her in point of fortune, and...without a profession'. Constable's friend and biographer C.R. Leslie reports that for five years Maria was treated 'as if she were a boarding-school girl in danger of falling a prey to a fortune-hunter'. At 29, however, 'she felt entitled to determine for herself a matter which so entirely affected her own happiness.' They were married on 2 October 1816 at St Martin's Church by Constable's friend the Reverend John Fisher. Fisher invited them to stay with his wife of three months and himself in Osmington near Weymouth, 'The country here is wonderfully wild and sublime, and well worth a painter's visit.' There is some disagreement over whether this painting of Weymouth Bay is a sketch painted out of doors during Constable's honeymoon, or a later work prepared for sale on the basis of sketches made at this time and left unfinished. It seems so fresh and spontaneous that most viewers have wished it to be a direct record of Constable's visit, his easel set a little west of Redcliff Point, facing Jordan Hill and Furzy Cliff on a gusty October day. The reddish brown of the priming shows through the blue sky and water, lending a warm glow to the landscape, which is framed and 'pushed back' by a promontory on the right and rocks and pebbles at the lower edge, painted freely but in greater detail than the rest. The glory of Weymouth Bay, however is the cloudscape: clouds rising from the horizon to form the 'vault of the sky', that pictorial discovery of Dutch seventeenth-century marine painting. Constable's early employment in his father's mill must indeed have alerted him to the appearance and behaviour of clouds. It is all the more moving, therefore, to find that in his youthful exertions to train himself in art he had sat down and carefully copied and labelled a series of cloud patterns published in 1785 for the use of his pupils by Alexander Cozens, a landscape painter and drawing master. There are no more truthful studies of clouds than those by Constable, but even the observant windmiller had to acquire a vocabulary of representation before setting them down in paint.",

        "description": "After about 1642 Cuyp came under the influence of painters in Utrecht like Jan Both, who had worked for several years in Italy. His tight descriptive early style, nurtured by Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael, now suddenly gave way to a broader, more effulgent style in which the landscape is soaked in a golden light. This style reaches its climax during the 1650s when Cuyp created an imaginary landscape based on personal recollections of the North, but transformed by an appreciation of the South, particularly the Italian campagna, derived from other painters. A distant view, bathed in mist and the warm glow of a late afternoon light, proved irresistible to early collectors. River Landscape with Horseman and Peasants (London, National Gallery), which was  painted around 1655, is perhaps the finest example of Cuyp's mature style, but The Negro Page, dating in all probability from a few years earlier, is not far removed in quality. The types of the buildings, the hilly background and the lake are common to both paintings and may be a reflection of Cuyp's journey up the Rhine as far as Nijmegen and Kleve, near the German border, at the beginning of the 1650s. Cuyp was economical with his motifs and several of those in The Negro Page recur in other paintings. For example, in Huntsman halted (Birmingham, Barber Institute of Fine Arts) Cuyp deploys similar horses, dogs and groom in a different composition. Dappled horses and negro pages are frequently found in other works by the artist of comparable date. The spaniel in the foreground of the present work is similarly posed in the painting of Orpheus (Marquess of Bute's collection). Some of the motifs are the subject of preparatory drawings either by Cuyp or his studio, such as the spaniel (Vienna, Albertina), the greyhound and the vegetation on the left (Paris, Lugt Foundation; London, British Museum, amongst others). The figure on the right facing the viewer has been tentatively identified as one of Cornelis van Beveren's sons, perhaps Willem (born 1624) who was appointed Bailiff and Dyke-Reeve of the Lande van Strien in 1648. This identification is based on the fact that his mount's horse brass is in the form of a fleur-de-lys, which suggests a connection with France (a knighthood was conferred on Cornelis van Beveren by the French king, Louis XIII). Cuyp spent nearly all of his life in Dordrecht. His marriage in 1650 to Cornelia Boschman, the widow of a wealthy Regent, led to a decline in his artistic output as he devoted more time to a career in public life. His work was particularly appreciated by members of the Regent class in Dordrecht, and Cuyp deliberately cultivated the social mores in the paintings dating from the 1650s. These social distinctions are detectable in dress, the emphasis on equitation, the relationship of the figures to architecture and the prominence of servants.",

        "description": "Among his contemporaries, Philips Koninck was known as a figure painter, specializing in portraits as well as in genre and religious scenes, rather than as a landscapist as he is known today. He was born in Amsterdam, the son of a successful goldsmith, and trained in the studio of his brother, Jacob, who worked in Rotterdam. Subsequently he returned to Amsterdam, where he lived for the rest of his life. Koninck was a wealthy man, owning a company which operated trekschuiten (horse-drawn passenger barges) between Rotterdam and Amsterdam. He seems to have been a friend rather than a pupil of Rembrandt but he was certainly influenced by him in his manner of painting(and drawing) biblical subjects. Koninck's landscapes are characterized by a high viewpoint and a sky which occupies at least half of the picture space. They are cloudscapes as much as extensive landscapes. He emphasizes the flatness of Holland, a more realistic approach than, for example, that of Aelbert Cuyp, who attempts to make his landscapes more varied by the inclusion of hills and mountains taken from his imagination rather than from his observation of the Dutch countryside. The landscape with a high sky was particularly in favour in the 1650s and 1660s, not just in the work of Koninck, but also in that of Jacob van Ruisdael and also in the etched landscapes of Rembrandt. This painting of 1655 is an outstanding example of Koninck's landscape art. The colours, which in some of his canvases have sunk into uniform browns and greys with the passage of time, are particularly vivid and the painting is remarkably well preserved.",

        "school": "Italian",
        "type": "religious",
        "description": "The picture shows the central panel of the St Lucy Altarpiece. The altarpiece was commissioned by the Confraternity of Santa Lucia of Iesi in 1523, however, the execution started only in 1528 and ended in 1532. The predella was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. The altarpiece was placed in the church of St Florian at Iesi, and it was transferred to the museum in 1861 (both the main panel and the predella panels). Now over fifty years old, Lotto tended to tone down the bright colours with a dimmer gradation of light. The scene is depicted through various minor episodes, but the narration is brought alive, above all, by the interior pathos of the  protagonists, who are all characterised with great sentimental acuity. Unusual for the period, the main panel of the altarpiece shows not a timeless group of saints, nor even a scene from the life of Christ or the Virgin Mary, but an episode in the life of St Lucy belonging to the same narrative sequence as the scenes in the predella. In depicting the story Lotto faithfully followed the account given in the Golden Legend, compiled in the late thirteenth century by Jacobus da Voragine, and by the early sixteenth century widely available in Italian translation. The story of St Lucy begins in the left predella panel, in which the future saint, daughter of a noble family in Syracuse, visits the shrine of St Agatha with her mother Euthicia, who for four years has been suffering from an incurable issue of blood. The two women kneel near an altar during the celebration of mass, during which the priest reads the passage from the gospel describing the miraculous cure by Jesus of the woman suffering from the same affliction as Euthicia. Euthicia prays at the shrine for a similar cure while Lucy, asleep, experiences a vision of St Agatha surrounded by angels. When she awakens, Lucy cures her mother, and begs to be released from her promise to marry, so that she can give away her dowry to the poor. The story in this panel closes with the women distributing alms to beggars in rag. The scene in the first predella panel is set in a Renaissance church, the architectural spaces of which provide distinct areas for the successive events. St Lucy is represented four times, she is identifiable by her yellow robe, red cloak, and laurel crown. The second scene is restricted to a narrow field on the left of the central predella panel, bounded by the green curtain. Lucy's fiancé, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel. The story continues on the main panel of the altarpiece which depicts St Lucy Seized by the Panders. In this scene Paschasius summons the panders to \"invite the crowd to have pleasure with this woman, and let them abuse her body until she dies; but the panders tried to carry her off, the Holy Ghost made her so heavy that they were unable to move her.\" At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fiancé assists the panders in their fruitless efforts. The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. The extension of this fourth scene across more than half of the width of the entire predella, represents a highly original approach to predella design. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella.",

        "description": "The work of the Dutch still-life painters who appear around 1620 corresponds to the tonal trend of the landscapists of van Goyen's generation. Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz. Heda, popularizers of the breakfast piece, are the principal representatives of this phase. Claesz, the father of the landscapist Nicolaes Berchem, was born at Berchem (probably the village near Antwerp). Heda's origins are obscure. Both were primarily active at Haarlem and underwent similar stylistic developments. Their early works show the influence of the older still-life painters, but they soon limited themselves to the description of a simple meal set near the corner of a table - some bread and cheese, a herring on a pewter dish, a glass of beer or wine, perhaps a silvery pewter vessel, and a white crumpled tablecloth - just enough to suggest a light breakfast or snack. These objects, which always look as if they had been touched by someone who is still close by, are no longer treated as isolated entities: they are grouped together, forming masses along a single diagonal axis. But more important, Pieter Claesz and Heda reacted to the comprehensive forces of light and atmosphere which envelop us and the things with which we live, and they found means to express their reactions to these forces as accurately, immediately, and intensely as possible. As a result, they seem to animate their simple subjects. With a new pictorial mode, they achieve a more dynamic spatial and compositional treatment. The foreground of their unpretentious arrangements becomes spacious, and there is clear recession. Instead of vivid local colours, monochromatic harmonies with sensitive contrasts of valeurs of low intensity are favoured, without, however, a loss of the earlier regard for textural differentiation. From the point of view of composition and of colouristic, tonal, and spatial treatment the perfectly balanced still-lifes by Claesz and Heda are among the most satisfying Dutch paintings made during the century. Claesz has a more vigorous touch than Heda. He was also a man of simpler tastes. Heda depicts oysters more frequently than herrings, and after 1640 his compositions became larger, richer, and more decorative. To obtain a more monumental effect, during his maturity Heda often abandons the traditional horizontal format for a vertical one. Ornate silver vessels and costly 'façon de Venise' glasses, at the time blown in the Netherlands as well as Venice, intensify the contrasts of valeurs, and touches of colour provided by the pink of sliced hams and ripe fruit are combined with an increased chiaroscuro.",

Provenance: This painting seems to be identical with the one listed in the Amsterdam sale of 1696 under no. 11: \"A soldier with a laughing girl, very beautiful, by ditto, fl 44.10.\" Subsequently, it appeared at a London sale of 1861 as by Pieter de Hooch, and again under the same attribution at sales in Paris in 1866 and 1881. From there it went, via the collection of Samuel S. Joseph and his widow, to the New York art dealer Knoedler, from whom it was acquired by H. C. Frick in 1911. While painting with a brush loaded with pigments and applying them in a granulous fashion by thick dabs, Vermeer ingeniously develops his mastery as a luminist. The young woman is bathed in light, which streams in through the half open window to the left, and reflects itself from the cream-coloured background that is enhanced to the left by very thin glazes of slightly pinkish tonalities. Her face, exceptionally conveying expression  - joy and laughter - appears framed in a kerchief and the collar of her dress. That part of the figure, especially, reveals itself as a symphony of luminosity, set off by the dark sleeves of the yellow jacket on which glittering highlights dance. In contrast, the soldier in the black hat and red jacket is placed close to the viewer, from whom he turns his back. He is hardly more than a silhouette, but rather overpowering, given the relative importance accorded his bodily appearance. The nearest foreground - the soldier on his chair and the dark-green part of the table cover - are so strongly enhanced that the use of an optical instrument by Vermeer for the structuring of the composition seems indisputable. We have here the typical effect of the inverted telescope: the foreground standing out in the manner of stage scenery, while the figure of the girl recedes into space. On the back of the wall, we find for the first time a map. This element of decoration reappears frequently in the artist's subsequent works.",

It is not certain that the predella and the crowning element originally formed part of the same altarpiece; and the accuracy of the entire reconstruction is in doubt. The panels are the following:  Central panel: Madonna and Child (165 x 80 cm); side panels: Sts Jerome, Alexander, Vincent, Anthony (137 x 39 cm each); upper side panels: Sts Clare, Bonaventura, Louis, Bernardino (126 x 40 cm each); upper centralaa panel: St Francis (128 x 82 cm); predella panels showing scenes from the Life of Christ (87 x 30 cm each) and two Angels in Adoration (27 x 29 cm each). This altarpiece belongs to Foppa's early stylistic maturity and retains the archaising tendency toward simplification of his youthful period, before he was influenced by Leonardo and Bramante. It also shows the pungent impetuosity of Mantegna's influence in the sharply drawn perspective, and in the tension and almost metallic consistency of the forms. In this resplendent altarpiece, the central panels are particularly fine examples of Foppa's masterly interweaving of colour and light. The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute. In the panel above, St Francis appears as a motionless, somewhat astonished figure immersed in the limpid air of a lyric landscape.",

In his paintings the stage changed from being an incidental setting of the picture to become the theme of the picture itself. Following his works showing the rehearsal room and the stage as a whole (even when only a corner is depicted), there came his series of astounding variations on the theme of dancers, in groups or isolated, in which the artist gained more and more freedom of vision, forever changing angles and capturing the ballerinas in the most surprising positions. The dancers are painted more and more in close-up. They do not move within a well-defined three-dimensional space, they fill the foreground with colours against the wings and curtains. The most remarkable among these works are the different versions of Ballerina with a Bouquet, Curtsying. The dancer is a sylph, arms outstretched, and still carried by the last movement at the close of her solo. She bows, bathed in the brilliant spotlight, with the unreal, fantastic decor of the ballet as her background.",

Van Eyck is concerned with showing the presence of a vision and therefore of illustrating the reality of God in our world. Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. Hans Belting is of the opinion that this picture once hung in the choir of the now destroyed church. This would mean that the depicted location mirrored the real location. Van der Paele would therefore have been able to see himself in the very place of his depicted vision and so \"prove\" to the world at large the reality of his divine experience. The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. On the other hand, the reliefs and sculptures on the capitals in the background and on the Virgin's throne all allude to Christ's salvation of humanity. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. Redemption from sin (Cain killing his brother) is possible only through the power of faith (Samson overpowering the lion). The goodness and grace of God \"at the moment of truth\" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele). This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon.",

The angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation are separated by two small panels, one with the representation of an arched window looking out upon a city square, and the other with a wash basin and ewer set into a niche and a white towel hanging from a rail beside it. A striking feature is the disparity in the scale of the various figures: no less than four changes of scale exist of the outside of the wings. There are also disparities in approach; some parts are almost prosaically factual, others almost visionary in approach. Three orders of reality are present: a narrative representation of a sacred subject (the Annunciation), two highly factual donor portraits and two simulated sculptures. Yet there is a strong attempt to impose a uniform framework on these disparate elements through the governing factor of  the light, which falls uniformly in all the panels from the right, and also through the use in the upper panels of a beamed ceiling running through the whole scene, and, in the lower panels, of the same cusped trefoil arches to frame the figures.",

Among the assistants who were given the job of translating the master's ideas into painting was probably his son Francesco. The Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse originally stood on the road between Castelfiorentino and Castelnuovo Val d'Elsa. In 1853 a Neo-Gothic chapel was built around it in order to transform it into an oratory, however, this was not sufficient to arrest the deterioration of the murals. Detached and restored in 1970, they have been remounted in the Biblioteca Comunale. The focal point is formed by a wall fresco which creates the illusion of a lavishly framed altar painting with a predella. In order to support the illusion, Gozzoli painted a small pointed picture on the lower frame showing the face of Christ, just as if it had been added at a later stage in the manner of a votive picture. On the cross vault are depicted the four Evangelists and Christ Giving his Blessing, on the keystone. The Dormitio Virginis is on the left wall and the Assumption, with the delivery of the Virgin's girdle to St Thomas, on the right wall. The fading or even complete disappearance of the more fragile zones of colour has greatly impoverished the scenes, in which Benozzo has sought variety within symmetry, emphasizing the correspondences between the two wall scenes.",

It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden. Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left. The sacra conversazione is transformed into an informal and incidental narrative that takes place in a landscape. A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Their poses are particularly hard to reconstruct because they are either figures covered by draperies that effectively hide their structure, or are in intricate unnatural positions. As Correggio grew older, he began to take liberties with the conventions regarding the proportion of figures. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head. The pictorial effects derive from a masterly application of the oil paint, confident and elegant colour, and idealized, refined faces.",

The commission consisted of four paintings, two in the arched spaces  beneath the small dome of the nave and two more in the same format  placed at the head of the aisles. The nave paintings represent the pious legend of the founding of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, the mother church of Santa María Blanca. According to this story, a Roman patrician, John, and his wife had pledged their wealth to the Virgin. She rewarded their piety by appearing in a dream and instructed them to build a church in her name on the Esquiline Hill, in accordance with a plan that would be traced on the surface of a miraculous summertime snowfall. The couple rushed to report their vision to Pope Liberius (352-366), who had also been visited by the Virgin, and all proceeded to the designated place, where they witnessed the miraculous fall of snow. Following the heaven-sent plan, they built the church and named it Santa Maria della Neve, the Italian word for \"snow,\" which coincides with the name of the Sevillian canon, Justino de Neve (1625-1685), who was one of Murillo's principal patrons and who commissioned the redecoration of the Santa María Blanca, originally a synagogue and later converted into a church. In the two lunettes dedicated to this story (Dream of Patrician John and Patrician John Reveals his Dream to Pope Liberius, both in the Prado, Madrid), Murillo intensified the sketchy, sfumato technique first used in the Birth of the Virgin (Louvre, Paris). The consonance between the gentle narrative and the warm, intimate style seems effortless, so much so that it is easy to overlook the confident artistry of the complicated poses and the dextrous brushwork in the background.",

        "description": "In 1550, Vasari wrote that a picture which according to him announced the arrival of spring was in the Medici villa in Castello. In 1477, the estate was acquired by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who was a second cousin of Lorenzo the Magnificent. This is why it was long assumed that the Primavera (Spring), as the painting continues to be called, was painted for the fourteen year old Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco when the villa was bought. An inventory dating from 1499, which was not discovered until 1975, lists the property of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni and states that in the 15th century the Primavera had been displayed in Florence's city palace. The painting decorated an anteroom attached to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's chambers. Such large format paintings were nothing new in high-ranking private residences. The Primavera is, however, special in that it is one of the first surviving paintings from the post-classical period which depicts classical gods almost naked and life-size. Some of the figures are based on ancient sculptures. These are, however, not direct copies but are translated into Botticelli's own unconventional formal language: slender figures whose bodies at times seem slightly too long. Above all it is the women's domed stomachs that demonstrate the contemporary ideal of beauty. Venus is standing in the centre of the picture, set slightly back from the other figures. Above her, Cupid is aiming one of his arrows of love at the Three Graces, who are elegantly dancing a roundel. The garden of the goddess of love is guarded by Mercury on the left. Mercury, who is lightly clad in a red cloak covered with flames, is wearing a helmet and carrying a sword, clearly characterizing him as the guardian of the garden. The messenger of the gods is also identified by means of his winged shoes and the caduceus staff which he used to drive two snakes apart and make peace; Botticelli has depicted the snakes as winged dragons. From the right, Zephyr, the god of the winds, is forcefully pushing his way in, in pursuit of the nymph Chloris. Next to her walks Flora, the goddess of spring, who is scattering flowers. Various interpretations of the scene exist. Leaving aside the suppositions there remains the profoundly humanistic nature of the painting, a reflection of contemporary cultural influences and an expression of many contemporary texts. One source for this scene is Ovid's Fasti, a poetic calendar describing Roman festivals. For the month of May, Flora tells how she was once the nymph Chloris, and breathes out flowers as she does so. Aroused to a fiery passion by her beauty, Zephyr, the god of the wind, follows her and forcefully takes her as his wife. Regretting his violence, he transforms her into Flora, his gift gives her a beautiful garden in which eternal spring reigns. Botticelli is depicting two separate moments in Ovid's narrative, the erotic pursuit of Chloris by Zephyr and her subsequent transformation into Flora. This is why the clothes of the two women, who also do not appear to notice each other, are being blown in different directions. Flora is standing next to Venus and scattering roses, the flowers of the goddess of love. In his philosophical didactic poem, De Rerum Nature the classical writer Lucretius celebrated both goddesses in a single spring scene. As the passage also contains other figures in Botticelli's group, it is probably one of the main sources for the painting: \"Spring-time and Venus come,/ And Venus' boy, the winged harbinger, steps on before,/ And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,/ Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all/ With colours and with odours excellent.\"",

The frescoes, finished in 1493, display the artist's new visual experiences, including an awareness of Melozzo da Forli's art. Analogous daring foreshortenings are found in Lippi's Assumption for the massive altar wall of the chapel. Filippino's music-making angels are skillfully incorporated into the curve of the wall, and their joyful celebration is appropriate to the occasion. There is no single point of sight for these images; some are seen sharply from below, others are nearly perpendicular to the surface plane. As a result, an implication of celestial movement into space is first established and then denied. The angels have sweeping, agitated draperies that indicate movement, but emphasis is placed on the edges of forms so that they appear flat and linear rather than three-dimensional. Although the limbs of the figures are monumentalised to some extent, the total impression remains decidedly lyric. Mary, standing on a cloud bank, is heavily draped, and the presumed weight-free left leg emerges beneath the swells of the garment, in a shift from the normal gravitational logic.",

What made the festival unique was that here, for one evening of gorging and dancing, the strict distinction between the nobility, the burghers and the poor fisher-folk was suspended. From the bank between the water and the houses the view is toward the west, where the church of Santa Marta closes off the buildings. To the left of the church the silhouette of the island of San Giorgo in Alga appears on the horizon, in the left corner is a house on another small island. Fishing boats decorated with balloons sail about, while tents and windscreens for the many musicians and cooks are spread over the grounds. A gondoliers assistant and his lady dance the furlana to the accompaniment of violin, guitar and tamborine, while a distinguished- looking foreigner is cajoled into dancing by a woman of the working class. The multitude of diverse visual elements has been neatly arranged by Canaletto along two crossing diagonals, with the church at the point of intersection. The artist chose a somewhat elevated vantage point, making it possible to survey a wide variety of individual scenes at the same time. It is not clear whether such a point of view was indeed possible on the spot. What is certain is that Canaletto first drew the various parts separately on several sheets; of these, two have survived with fragments of the houses in the background, which the artist must have sketched from different spots. With the help of these he built up the composition, according to a scheme identical to that of the diplomatic receptions painted on various different occasions. The painting is something of a humorous commentary on this: the people's festival supplants the public one, just as the moon does the sun. Canaletto painted the canvas for the merchant Sigismund Streit, who was originally from Berlin. Streit had made his fortune in Venice after settling there as a young man in 1705. When he retired from business in 1750, he devoted himself to study and to the accumulation of a modest collection of paintings. Part of his painting collection has been preserved, including four canvases by Canaletto among them the Vigilia di Santa Marta and the Vigilia di San Pietro, another night view.",

The first known French works are dated from the 1620s and were popular among scholars who considered these paintings as worthy of display in cabinets of curiosities. The present still-life adapts the subject of a simple basket filled with damson plums arranged frontally on a table. The rigorous composition is pure and balanced. The composition is staged against a dark background highlighting the Caravaggesque theatrical effect. The table's edge is part of the composition. It is visible throughout the length of the panel and is described with great realism. The light projects from beyond the frame and from the left. It draws the shadow of the basket and accentuates the drama and realism. The painting is signed and dated lower right: Louyse Moillon / 1629.",

He then spent time in Italy before returning to settle permanently in Antwerp in 1609. At a time when orders were pouring in, painters made use of specialised colleagues for certain parts of the works. Artists like Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens and Cornelis de Vos all called on Frans Snyders to produce the animal motifs in their paintings. The scene is set in the kitchen of a vast house. A maidservant, said to be painted by Cornelis de Vos, is carrying a tray full of quails and crowned with a pheasant. Her head turned to the right, she is standing alongside a large rectangular table spilling over with victuals. The painting is organised on several levels around a white swan, whose body and outstretched wings occupy the centre of the scene. Next to it, a gutted roebuck is hanging by one paw from a hook. A lobster, a peacock and some birds are laid out on the table. A wicker basket spilling over with fruit and a copper basin with quarters of meat add to the impression of abundance. A rack at the top of the painting from which hang two salmon steaks, birds and two hares, strengthens the horizontal aspect of the composition. In the left foreground, a plate of oysters is placed on a bench, whilst, to the far right, a wicker basked is laden profusely with fruits and vegetables. A cat, preparing to steal fish from a serving dish, and a dog, avidly viewing the servant's plate, provide a lively contrast to the dead animals. The Pantry is similar to monumental paintings mixing people and still-lifes created by Aertsen, Beuckelaer and Lucas van Valckenborch. The work probably has a deeper meaning. It would well be that the poultry, the parrot, the dog, the cat and the roebuck embody the five senses, whilst the birds, the fish, the fruit and vegetables, the lobster and the game symbolise the four elements of air, water, earth and fire respectively. In the same order of things, the maidservant and the birds (the Dutch word \"vogelen\", literally \"to bird\", also refers to the sexual act) are perhaps an allusion to worldly temptations and to physical love.",

A source of inspiration for the painting was the polar expedition mounted by William Edward Parry from 1819 to 1820 in search of the North-west Passage. The painting's icy palette corresponds to the Arctic setting. It is undoubtedly one of the artist's masterpieces, yet the radical nature of its composition and subject was greeted in its own day with incomprehension and rejection. The picture remained unsold right up to Friedrich's death in 1840. In the painting, now often called The Wreck of the Hope, the painter imbued the subject with unsurpassable dramatic intensity. The particular feature of this work is that the drama has already happened. The huge towering pinnacles are the slowly moving icebergs that have long become fixed here. The bold attempt by man to burst the bounds of his allotted sphere ends in death. When the artist was 13, an accident occurred, that, perhaps subconsciously, formed part of the shadow that seemed to darken his temperament throughout his life. While ice skating he was saved from drowning by his younger brother Christoph, but Christoph himself drowned in the icy water before his eyes. It can be hardly denied that Friedrich's various \"sea of ice\" paintings must be seen in relation to this traumatic experience.",

        "description": "Johann Christian Fischer (1733-1800) was an outstanding musician. He was born in Germany at Freiburg-im-Breisgau and played for a time in the court band at Dresden before entering the service of Frederick the Great. On coming to London, where he is first recorded on 2 June 1768, he became a member of Queen Charlotte's Band and played regularly at court. His performance of Handel's fourth oboe concerto during the Handel Commemoration at Westminster Abbey in 1784 gave particular pleasure to George III. Regardless of such successes, he failed in 1786 to secure the post of Master of the King's Band. He collapsed in 1800 while playing in a concert at court and died shortly afterwards. Fischer was a composer and virtuoso oboist. His two-keyed oboe is visible on the harpsichord-cum-piano against which the musician leans. Fanny Burney praised the 'sweet-flowing, melting celestial notes of Fischer's hautboy,' but the Italian violinist Felice de' Giardini (1716-93) referred to Fischer's 'impudence of tone as no other instrument could contend with.' In the portrait on the chair behind Fischer is a violin, on which he was apparently also an accomplished performer although only in private. The harpsichord-cum-piano, made by Joseph Merlin who came to London from the Netherlands in 1760 and established a successful business in the production of pianofortes, presumably refers to his abilities as a composer, as no doubt do the piles of musical scores. This portrait of Johann Christian Fischer stands as testimony to Gainsborough's own love of music. The artist preferred the company of actors, artists, dramatists and musicians to that of politicians, writers or scholars, and was himself a talented amateur musician in addition to being a painter. Gainsborough once wrote to William Jackson: 'I'm sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my Viol da Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village when I can paint Landskips and enjoy the fag End of Life in quietness and ease.' Yet some of his finest portraits are of musicians and include, in addition to that of Fischer, the composer Karl Friedrich Abel (San Marino, Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery) and Johann Christian Bach (Bologna, Museo Civico, Bibliografico Musicale). These two portraits date from the late 1770s, whereas that of Johann Christian Fischer was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. Gainsborough seems to have known Fischer while he was still living in Bath (Fischer moved permanently to London in 1774). As early as 1775 Fischer evinced an interest in the artist's elder daughter Mary (1748-1826), whom he married at St Ann's Church, Soho, on 21 February 1780. The wedding was agreed to reluctantly by Gainsborough, who, although he admired Fischer as a musician, perhaps hoped that his elder daughter might make a better marriage, and lodged doubts about the musician's character. He wrote to his sister on 23 February 1780: 'I can't say I have any reason to doubt the man's honesty or goodness of heart, as I never heard anyone speak anything amiss of him; and as to his oddities and temper, she must learn to like as she likes his person, for nothing can be altered now. I pray God she may be happy with him and have her health.' The marriage did not last and Mary gradually became insane. Whatever tensions Gainsborough might have been experiencing with regard to Fischer's relationship with his daughter, Gainsborough's portrait is masterly in its compositional sophistication, use of colour and sympathetic characterisation. It is clear, however, that the likeness has been painted over another portrait which will no doubt be revealed by X-ray. The portrait came into the Royal Collection indirectly. It appears to have been painted for Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon (died 1799), a radical politician and a talented amateur musician, but was sold by his successor. Eventually it was acquired by Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, who in 1809 presented it to his brother, the Prince of Wales (later George IV). Both were admirers of Gainsborough's work.",

At the same time, the theme of the struggling angel also symbolized the triumph of light over the rebellion of the powers of darkness - giving the painter an opportunity to create a chiaroscuro charged with meaning, in which heaven and hell, the incense of the blessed and the brimstone of the damned are contrasted in an extremely confined space, creating an arc of tension within which the knight-like angel spreads his broad wings and wields his sword in a sweeping gesture of victory. Giordano sets the scene with relatively few figures compared to, say, Rubens' Great Last Judgment. Against a background of deep golden light, the archangel balances with an almost balletic movement on the heavy breast of Lucifer, entangled amidst a group of his servants, his angular and batlike wings cutting through the hazy sfumato of the hellfire. What appears at first glance to be so dramatic is not in fact the depiction of a struggle as such. Michael is not attacking the figures from hell with his sword, but is holding it aloft like a sign, as though his mere appearance were enough to cast Satan and his followers into eternal damnation.",

Bas, a director of the Dutch East India Company who had served as burgomaster of the city on several occasions. She married Nicholas van Bambeeck (1596-1661), a successful cloth merchant who was an immigrant from Flanders, when she was twenty-seven. Rembrandt had probably known Bambeeck for some time before he painted both his portrait and the companion portrait of Agatha. In 1631 Bambeeck was living in the Sintanthonisbreestraat, where Rembrandt was also staying in the house of the art dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh; both Rembrandt and Bambeeck invested in Uylenburgh's business in 1640. The pair of canvasses depicting Bambeeck and his wife are superb examples of the accomplished and imposing portraits bathed in soft light which Rembrandt was painting in the years around 1640. He placed both husband and wife in illusionistic painted frames, an effect heightened by the cloak and glove seemingly hanging over the edge of the frame in Nicholas's portrait, and the fingers of Agatha's left hand which appear to project beyond the frame here. Unfortunately both paintings have been cut down at the top and sides, removing part of the painted frames and so weakening the trompe l'oeil effect. Originally the portraits would have been shown in arched ebony frames, echoing their painted counterparts, and so further merging painted appearances and reality. The paintings hung together until they were sold in London in 1814. Agatha Bas was bought in 1819 by Lord Yarmouth acting for the Prince Regent and so entered the Royal Collection. Nicolaes van Bambeeck was purchased by the Musée Royale des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, in 1841.",

They are wide in scale and the atmosphere is of broad daylight. There is a complete balance between careful observation of the reality of the Roman Campagna and the need to produce an organized composition. Unfortunately both versions of the picture suffer from a problem afflicting a number of Claude's works, the darkening of the greens in the trees. This gives them a much greater solidity than the artist intended. Moreover, in Claude's later pictures there is also sometimes a fading out of the fugitive yellows he used, which gives the pictures a much stronger bluish hue than he intended. Painted in 1648, these two pictures sum up Claude s mature art. He had arrived at this maturity by degrees, almost imperceptibly, refining and perfecting his technique. He had for many years been drawing from nature almost obsessively, and several hundred of his sensitive and often atmospheric drawings survive. He was therefore able to combine the more naturalistic approach seen in the Ponte Molle of 1645 with an increasing desire to turn the landscape into an idealized world. He had tried dramatic atmosphere in some of his early compositions, and had succeeded with direct sunlight but had not pursued it; but he developed in his later years the soft and subtle light effects which were the most difficult of all to achieve convincingly. As he grew older Claude became even more meticulous, and his pictures never acquired the looseness sometimes seen in the works of painters in their old age, even Poussin. The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 113).",

Originally, the structure would have been gabled at the top, with elaborate gold moldings framing each section. According to legend, the Virgin entered the temple in Jerusalem at age three and remained until she was 14. In this depiction, she stands at the top of the long stair with a last sidelong look at her parents, yet she remains fearless and strong. Like those of the high priest who receives her, Mary's robes are splendid gold brocade. Equally lavish is the interior of Solomon's temple, which is treated as a Gothic church. A gallery at the right is filled with the girls who will be Mary's companions. On the other side, near Mary's parents, Anna and Joachim, an onlooker cranes for a glimpse and a woman kneels, her face half hidden by a pillar. Such rich details enliven and humanize a sacred event, making it more accessible to a contemporary viewer.",

Juan de Flandes demonstrated a preference for clearly articulated space and refined color schemes. Characteristic of paintings from the city of Ghent, charming narrative vignettes frequently enlivened the backgrounds of Juan's pictures. The Nativity is one of the six surviving panels of an altarpiece from the main chapel in the Church of San Lázaro, Palencia, in northern Castile. Juan's Nativity, as with many religious scenes, amplifies a biblical episode with theological references. The Gospel of Luke writes that the baby was wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Here, however, the child is naked and lies on his mother's robe upon the ground, implying that the son of god was poorer than the humblest son of man. The ox and ass, eating from the straw-filled manger, are not mentioned together in Luke. The Book of Isaiah, however, states that these beasts knew their master and his crib. Since a grain storage crib relates directly to Luke's feeding manger, early Christian scholars believed that Isaiah's prophesy was fulfilled when even the livestock would recognize Jesus as their master. Meanwhile, illuminating the starry night, concentric rings of divine light emanate from the angel appearing to the shepherds on the distant hilltop. Perched on the ruined stable, an owl may refer to the nocturnal darkness dispelled by the coming of Christ.",

        "description": "In 1436 Rogier van der Weyden was appointed to the office of town painter of Brussels, the most important city in  the duchy of Brabant and one of the main residences of the Duke of Burgundy. Rogier's position is probably connected with his acceptance of the most important commission the city could give an artist, the huge Scenes of Justice for the town hall. (Unfortunately these were destroyed during the bombardment of Brussels by the French troops of Louis XIV in 1695.) This huge commission from the city must have demanded an enormous amount of working capacity on Rogier's part, and at the same time would have raised his reputation greatly. In Brussels, which appears to have had no artistic tradition of any significance before his arrival, he must soon have become a fashionable painter in great demand. For this large civic commission of course he needed assistants, who would also help to supply other demands. The regulations of the Brussels painters' guild allowed a master to have only one apprentice at a time, but placed no restriction on the number of journeymen he could employ. Rogier presumably employed more and more assistants to work on the pictures, though only a single original source refers to them: when an altarpiece was installed in Cambrai in 1459, several \"ouvriers\" (workmen, or more likely assistants) are mentioned. Among extant paintings, there are already works from around 1440 which closely resemble Rogier's artistically, but are different from paintings by his own hand, and so are probably by the employees of his workshop. At this point he would not have had time to train more than one apprentice to the point of being qualified to set up independently, so there can hardly have been any \"successors\" of Rogier yet. However, he could already have passed on his technique and style to a number of journeymen, who would then have been able both to assist him in working on the city's huge commission, and also to produce independent paintings of their own which could leave the workshop under the name of \"Rogier.\" Two panels with scenes from the life of St. Hubert show that he did in fact employ several relatively independent assistants. These scenes are very much in Rogier's style, but diverge from his major works in both execution and layout. Both panels were originally in the chapel of St Hubert in St Gudule, the main church of Brussels. The chapel was donated in 1437 by two prosperous citizens, Jan Cools and Jan Vrientschap, who probably commissioned the paintings at the same time; the two paintings seem originally to have been part of a larger series, and may well have been ready for the dedication of the chapel in 1439. These two extant panels are clearly the work of different artists, and indeed it seems likely, judging by the various different ways of painting faces, that several painters may have worked on the Exhumation of St Hubert. The two pictures are considerably different from each other in design, a feature particularly obvious in the differences of spatial depiction; the Exhumation of St Hubert, which is executed to a very high standard, is more convincing in this respect, and does not show the exaggerated effect of depth that makes the room in the Dream of Pope Sergius look like a tunnel. The scene showing the exhumation of St Hubert in 825 from his tomb in St Peter's Church, Liège, has been transferred to the choir of a modern Gothic church of Rogier's time. Bishop Walcaud of Liège, planning to move the corpse to the Benedictine abbey of Andage, is swinging a censer in the foreground left; Emperor Louis the Pious (778-840) and Archbishop Adelward of Cologne are kneeling one each side of the altar. The onlookers, who wear contemporary clothing, probably include the two donors of the pictures, with their families. The men who worked in Rogier's workshop were obviously more than mere humble assistants in the execution of paintings; when the number of commissions on hand made it necessary, they even designed pictures with relative independence. In doing so they naturally used their master's formulae and his figure types. Rogier's assistants also resorted to models already in the workshop for such features as the pattern of textiles; the patterned green fabric of the altar cloth in the Exhumation of St Hubert had already featured in the under-dress of the young woman to the left in the Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and the pattern appears again a good deal later in the scene of the Annunciation on the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), on a carpet.",

It is a glimpse to make anyone less forlorn as these creatures rise dripping from the waves. The green water itself becomes an exciting erotic element as it swells and falls, bearing up the pearl-pale bodies that abandon themselves to it and offer their limbs like branches of white coral as perches for Venus's doves. In place of Tiepolo's romantic nobility there is a human simplicity. Despite the snorting dolphins and having Tritons, the tumbling putti and the tremendous twist of silver and salmon-pink striped awning, the goddess remains a ravishingly pretty., demure girl, half-shy of the commotion of which she is the centre. She, like the nymphs around her, is reality idealized, divinely blonde and slender, touched with a voluptuous vacancy, a lack of animation, which perhaps only increase her charm. The insolent consciousness of Tiepolo's people is replaced here by innocence bordering on stupidity; herself so desirable, the goddess seems without desires. Boucher keeps much closer than Tiepolo to the terms of ordinary experience; his idealizing touches are restricted to the refining of ankles and wrists, perfecting of the arc of the eyebrows, tinting a deeper red the lips and nipples. Both artists can be related to the sculpture of their period. Boucher belongs with the naturalistic nude statuettes of Falconet and Clodion; Tiepolo has much more in common with the extremes of gilded and rouged Bavarian rococo sculpture.",

Siro in Genoa) and is probably his most celebrated work, often considered his masterpiece. The huge red drape hanging behind the Madonna's pure white bed is an overt homage to Caravaggio. Indeed it is to him that the canvas owes its overall sense of vibrant reality, its light and its feeling. Nevertheless, Gentileschi reworked the basic style of Caravaggio's expressive art in an unusually rich fashion. He freely applied colour in a manner akin to the great Flemish painters of the day, such as Rubens or Van Dyck, who were either working in Genoa or whose canvases could be viewed there. In addition, his impeccable draughtsmanship, derived from his Tuscan background, emphasized the refined and noble qualities of the picture.",

        "description": "Born in Dordrecht, Maes went to Amsterdam in about 1650 to study with Rembrandt. He was back in his native city by 1653 and stayed until 1673, when he returned to settle in Amsterdam. By 1654 he had abandoned Rembrandt's way of painting in favour of small domestic interiors depicting the life of women and children. They differ from similar subjects painted by de Hooch in their extensive use of glossy black and warm reds, and the strong contrasts between light and dark, but some share de Hooch's interest in views into another room or space - although we don't know of any direct connection between the two painters. From 1660 Maes confined himself to portraiture, in time adopting the elegant French style favoured in Holland in the latter part of the century. The attribution of this huge picture has been the subject of much debate, but it is now generally accepted as an early work by Maes painted either during his time in Rembrandt's studio or just after. One of his two surviving preparatory compositional sketches is loosely based on Rembrandt's famous Hundred Guilder Print. Both works illustrate a passage from the Gospel of Saint Matthew: 'Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven' (19:13-14). In Maes's picture dark browns and blacks are enlivened with touches of cream and red - most striking in the cheeks of the little girl on whom Jesus has 'put his hands' and who turns around shyly and uncomprehendingly, finger in mouth. Her school slate hangs at her side - for these are seventeenth-century Dutch mothers and children who crowd around Jesus, although he, like Saint Peter standing rebuked behind the tree and the man lifting up the child (a disciple removing an infant, or a father jumping the queue?), is wearing 'timeless' dress. The young man awkwardly squeezed in at the left is likely to be a self portrait, a reminder that this picture is dated to Maes's late 'teens. He has followed all the precepts for monumental narrative painting - the full-length figures on the scale of life, a significant and elevated biblical story, the poses and emotions of all the figures carefully delineated, the lights and darks disposed so as to highlight Jesus and the children - yet something genre-like and sentimental keeps breaking through. Whether because most patrons with space on their walls for a canvas of this size wanted something loftier than the homely figures depicted here, or whether Maes himself realised that 'history painting' was not what he wished to do, he was never again to attempt a picture on this ambitious scale.",
