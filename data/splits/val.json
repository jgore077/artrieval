    "images/PATON, Sir Joseph Noel/'Home' The Return from the Crimea.jpg": "'Home' depicts the return from the Crimea of a Corporal in the Scots Fusilier Guards. He has been wounded in the head and has lost his left arm. The Crimean medal, awarded by Queen Victoria in 1855 to all those who fought in that war, is worn on his uniform and below the chair is a trophy - a Russian helmet lying beneath the soldier's stick. The mother weeps over his shoulder, while his wife kneels and embraces him. A small child sleeps in the cot. The open Bible on the table indicates the source of the family's strength in the soldier's absence. The picture shows a reduced replica which was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1856.",

    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Stoning of St Stephen.jpg": "Here Carpaccio displays a totally mannered use of colour, bright and translucid in the scene of the martyrdom, and soft and veiled in the depiction of the mythical Jerusalem, enclosed by its high walls, each detail of its buildings described with care, and in the groups of figures themselves, patches of colour that shine in the light that varies according to the filtering action of the clouds in front of the sun.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Adoration of the Child with Saints.jpg": "Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\" hover above. These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light. The represented saints are the Young St John the Baptist and St Romuald.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Portrait of a Young Man with an Oil-lamp.jpg": "Lotto's early portrait of a young man wearing a round black beret and buttoned, black coat still owes much to the traditional aesthetic of imitation. The physiognomy of his powerful nose and searching grey-brown eyes, which, under the slightly knitted brow, seem to brood on the spectator, to view him almost with suspicion, is so faithful a rendering of empirical detail that we are reminded of another painter, one whose brushwork was learned from the Netherlandish masters: Antonello da Messina. A breeze appears to have blown the curtain aside, and in the darkness, through a tiny wedge-shaped crack along the right edge of the painting, we see the barely noticeable flame of an oil-lamp.",

In the niche behind the altar table is the tomb of the donor, Filippo Strozzi, above it on the altar wall, an allegorical pictorial program referring to the donor. In the stained-glass window a Madonna and Child and Philip and John as the chapel's patron saints are represented, in the vaulting compartment Adam and the serpent are depicted. The painted columns on either side of the pointed-arched window stand atop high pedestals that flank the round arch above the tomb. The spandrels above that arch are filled with puzzling paintings in grisaille: in each one a winged youth stands with one foot on a skull and holds out another skull in his hand. The theological virtues Fides and Caritas adorn the pedestals beneath the projecting columns on either side of the window. On the left, two putti playing instruments accompany a seated female figure identified by an inscription as Parthenice. There is a pair of women with masks of tragedy and comedy next to the right pilaster and above the inscription DEO MAX.",

    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Village Landscape in Morning Light (The Lone Tree).jpg": "The landscape-format composition presents a plain extending without interruption into the background, seen as if the viewer were standing on the gentle rise which begins in the bottom left and right-hand corners. From here, our gaze falls upon a small pond - to which no path leads - and upon a huge oak tree, which looks at first sight to be fairly close by. Once our eyes have also registered the diminutive figure of a shepherd leaning against its trunk, however, the tree suddenly appears further away and hence gigantic. While an idyll of unspoilt nature unfolds around the oak and the shepherd, the villages and church spires of the land developed by man are as it were concealed and compressed within a valley by the mountains and the sky high above.",

    "images/PALOMINO, Acislo Antonio/Allegory of Air.jpg": "The series consists of Air (by Palomino), Water (by Ezquerra), Earth (by Vaccaro) and Fire (by Palomino). Air, one of the four elements, is embodied by the goddess, Juno, who sits in a carriage drawn by the peacocks that customarily symbolize her. She is accompanied by the nymph, Iris, who frames the scene with her marvelous rainbow. On earth, under a leafy tree, two cupids play with soap bubbles, alluding to the ethereal nature of the element in question.",
    "images/CAMPEN, Jacob van/Mercury, Argus and Io.jpg": "Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. The inventive god approached the meadows and played songs on his pipe. Mercury beheads the sleeping guardian.",

    "images/MICHELINO DA BESOZZO/The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, St John the Baptist, St Antony Abbot.jpg": "The figures are improbably floating in shining, golden space. We cannot see the back of the throne, nor the spot where it touches the ground, or whether it has a pedestal and if so what it is like. Only the decorative contours of its arms are discernible in front of the dark areas provided by the figures of St Antony Abbot and St John the Baptist. And what we can see in this picture, namely the five figures, are depicted with delicate transitions of value from light to shade, which convey the soft features and the soft body of the Child Jesus. Their complexions display a wide variety of snow-white, pale pink, golden brown and dark-brown tones. The Virgin's head, rising in the middle, is surrounded by the semicircle of the other four heads. At the same time the dark draperies of the three figures in the back enclose the light areas of colour displayed by the body of the Child and the face and garments of St Catherine, thus presenting a fine equilibrium of colours in the composition.",

    "images/CABANEL, Alexandre/Portrait of the Comtesse de Keller.jpg": "In this portrait of a Russian aristocrat, Comtesse de Keller (née Maria Ivanovna Riznich), the dramatic use of light and shade stresses the paleness of the model's skin and heightens her facial features, giving her the look of an actress strongly lit on stage.",

    "images/HEYDEN, Jan van der/View of the Westerkerk, Amsterdam (1).jpg": "They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb.",
    "images/SEGNA DI BUONAVENTURE/St Silvester Gozzolini.jpg": "The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",

    "images/FOUQUET, Jean/Melun Diptych Estienne Chevalier with St Stephen.jpg": "The saint, wearing a deacon's robe, is holding a book, on which a jagged stone is lying, as a symbol of his martyrdom. The formal architecture in the background is in the Italian Renaissance style showing pilasters with coloured inlaid marble panels between them. On the wall, receding in perspective, the name Estienne Chevalier is inscribed several times.

    "images/FONTEBASSO, Francesco/Supplemental scene.jpg": "Completing the decoration are some other images that are not connected to the subject of the principal sections. Faux colonnades that reveal glimpses of imposing classical buildings frame a variety of figures, The present picture shows a soldier conversing with a dwarf jester dressed in elegant livery, who holds a small dog.",
    "images/MASTER THEODERIC/Paintings of Saints.jpg": "The robust features of the individual saints are impressively depicted. Ornamented with discs of gilded Venetian glass and strips of marble encrusted with semiprecious stones, the chapel seems like a Byzantine treasure chamber.",

    "images/TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de/In the Café The Guest and the Anaemic Cashier.jpg": "In both paintings a couple sit in front of a wall mirror, behind a table, and the bottle and glasses stand as a barrier between viewer and figures. Lautrec, however, directs the viewer's attention to the painful differences between the well-fed bourgeois and the pale, undernourished employee, who is pointedly turning away from her neighbour.",
    "images/BUYTEWECH, Willem Pietersz/Banquet in the Open Air.jpg": "On a stage-like floor, marked off from a garden by theatrical architecture, are two groups of people, both consisting of richly dressed ladies and flashy men. On the middle of the floor a table is set. One group is still seated next to the table; the other is standing on the right, displaying themselves and also, one has the impression, the table. Within this setting, two types of symbol have been introduced: symbols of Luxury (among others: the golden vases and decanters, the peacock on the table, the not quite contemporary fancy dress) and symbols of Vanity (the musical instruments on the floor).",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/Holy Family on the Steps.jpg": "Concerned with achieving a perfectly harmonized composition, the artist has contained the figures within a triangular format; the heads of the Virgin and the Christ Child being at the apex of this pyramid.",
    "images/SANCHEZ COTÁN, Juan/Still-life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber.jpg": "Everyday objects: a melon, cut open to reveal its pale pink flesh, a knobby cucumber, a yellow quince that is past its best, a cabbage with thick leaves. Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme.",
    "images/HAMEN, Juan van der/Serving Table.jpg": "The place of each form is firmly established by the strong, transparent shadows cast toward the right.",
    "images/MOLENAER, Jan Miense/Peasants in the Tavern.jpg": "There is almost no detail depicted in the interior of the tavern where this group of peasants are shown drinking and enjoying themselves. The peasants are colourful, picturesque characters who with their coarse clothes have been grouped to make an effective composition.",
    "images/VOS, Cornelis de/Elisabeth (or Cornelia) Vekemans as a Young Girl.jpg": "The portrait of Elisabeth Vekemans is incomplete, as we see from the unfinished background, the somewhat casual execution of the skirt and the absence of the mainly deep red, intensely colourful details like the socks, tie, jewellery and so on that might have enlivened the sombre, green palette.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Woman with a Mirror.jpg": "Depicted with loving care, his sitters - however idealized in the final composition - are too full of life and character not to have been taken from the model. She stands between two mirrors held up by an admirer in such a way that she can see herself and her admirer and we can see her from both front and back.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Portrait of a Man with a Medal of Cosimo the Elder.jpg": "The picture of this unidentified young man is one of the most unusual portraits of the Early Renaissance. The man is gazing at the observer and holding up a medal bearing the profile of the head of Cosimo de' Medici, who died in 1464. The painting is a a half length portrait in front of an extensive light landscape with a river, and the man's head projects above the horizon. The light, which falls on the subject from the left, clearly shapes his striking features, and there are stronger shadows on the side of his face closer to the observer.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The ceiling (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a transversal section of the ceiling with a smaller field of the apex of the ceiling. It demonstrates the following design elements:  thrones for the Prophets and Sibyls;  one of the seven Prophets (Ezekiel), one of the five Sibyls (Cumaean);  two of the twenty-four square pedestals forming niches for the Prophets and Sibyls and surmounted by twin 'putti' (a boy and a girl) in relief;  two small angels as a background to the enthroned figures;  two of the ten white angular cornices joining the capitals of the putti-pilasters;  four of the twenty 'ignudi' occupying the cornices, holding cornucopias, ribbons and garlands of fruit;  two of the ten gold medallions in reliefs depicting scenes from the Book of Kings and supported by two ignudi;  one of the five smaller fields of the apex of the ceiling guarded by four ignudi and covered by a scene from the Genesis (The Creation of Eve).",

    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Battle at Pons Milvius (detail) (2).jpg": "The picture shows the central group in the painting. In the sky above the actors accompanying angels aid Constantine's attack. Clouds directly to their right form a lion leaping forward to the right, an allusion to Leo X's name. The heavens declare Constantine's victory to be a \"leonine\" success.",
    "images/MASTER of Pratovecchio/Madonna and Child with Six Angels.jpg": "The composition of the relief on which this painting is based has a strongly Gothic flavour, with the Virgin seated beneath a tent-like canopy, form the apex of which a half-length figure of God the Father emerges, with angels piled up at the sides.",
    "images/DELACROIX, Eugène/Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi.jpg": "Its symbol was a young woman in national costume standing on a block of stone from which there emerges the hand of a dead insurgent.",

    "images/CIMABUE/Scenes from the Apocalypse.jpg": "In the south transept of the Upper Church, there are five scenes from the Apocalypse along the basamanto adjacent to the large Crucifixion fresco. The depictions include the Adoration of the Lamb by the Twenty-four Elders and Many Angels, the Angel of the Sixth Seal, the Angel Burning Incense on the Altar of God, the Angel Announcing the Fall of Babylon, and the Angel Sent by God to Show Him the \"Things Which Must Shortly Come to Pass\". The picture shows the first three of the scenes, namely the Adoration of the Lamb by the Twenty-four Elders and Many Angels, the Angel of the Sixth Seal, and the Angel Burning Incense on the Altar of God.",
    "images/MORLAITER, Michelangelo/Venetian Reception (detail) (1).jpg": "Inside seven large arches delimited by Ionic pilasters, he painted a large faux loggia, closed off at the back by a marble wall, against which statues of goddesses stand inside aedicules surmounted by rectangular tympanums. A carnival-like reception is under way on the loggia, and the participants include a number of elegant ladies and noblemen, some in wigs, some in three-cornered hats, as well as a prelate and an Eastern figure, all busy conversing amiably, or sipping coffee and liquors served by efficient waiters in livery.",
    "images/RÉGNIER, Nicolas/Cardsharps and Fortune Teller.jpg": "In a dark Roman inn, evoked by the ancient slab of stone, a sinister group of low-life types - a soldier, a muffled thief, courtesans, gypsies who seem to symbolize the perils of the world and the flesh - fleece two fashionable gulls. One falls prey to gypsies, while a young courtesan peers at the cards of his companion, signaling to a soldier accomplice, who has a card hidden in his palm.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Triptych of Adriaan Reins (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the central panel. Mary Magdalene wrings her hands in despair. Behind her on the right, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea open the sarcophagus. The ointment jar and copper jug for washing the body stand ready.",
    "images/ASAM, Cosmas Damian/Assumption of Mary.jpg": "The rather flat ceiling is decorated by a painted, illusionistic architecture. Above the oval main room of the monastery church, a broad concave moulding marks the transition to a domed ceiling. The vaulting opens up into a diadem borne by angels, reiterating the oval ground-plan. Illuminated by invisible windows, we see the saints of the Benedictine order in all the glory of the heavens. By creating a transition from oval to circle, Asam is able to interweave the clouds amongst the pillars so that they help to conceal the base of the (painted) round temple on the oval ceiling aperture. On the main side of the fresco we see St George with his eyes raised towards Mary as she is carried upwards to Christ and God, who is holding a crown above the starry nimbus around her head. It is the triumph of the church that is displayed here against the golden background bathed in light, and its effect is all the more overwhelming because Asam has made the architecture his accomplice in illusion.",
    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/View of the portego.jpg": "The portego is entirely surrounded by a balcony, originally meant to accommodate two orchestras, rimmed with a richly carved wooden balustrade.",

    "images/BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans/Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary.jpg": "Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary is an early work; it is, in fact, the first dated portrait in Baldung's oeuvre, painted on his return to Strasbourg two years after The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Nuremburg, Germänisches Nationalmuseum). At the upper edge in the centre, as part of the signature, is an image of an owl attacking a bird on a branch, which perhaps symbolises the conflict between good and evil or day and night.",

She is wearing a rose dress with lilac shadows, which is slipping off her shoulders; it is tied round the waist by a green sash bordered with yellow. The mantle folded back on her arm is deep yellow, while various colours are combined in her strange headdress.",

    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window.jpg": "In this painting, a young woman stands in the center of the composition, facing in profile an open window to the left. In the foreground is a table covered with the same Oriental rug encountered in the Woman Asleep. On it is the identical Delft plate with fruit. The window reflects the girl's features, while to the right the large green curtain forms a deceptive frame. She is precisely silhouetted against a bare wall that reflects the light and envelops her in its luminosity. She concentrates entirely upon the letter, holding it firmly and tautly, while she absorbs its content with utmost attention.",

Christ is standing on a sharp rocky outcrop in a radiant white garment, giving the blessing with His right hand and holding a closed scroll in His left. He is surrounded by an oval aureole of light, in which is inscribed a rectangle with inwardly curving sides, from which rays emanate towards Elijah and Moses, each standing on his own mountain summit in an attitude of veneration. Three further rays strike the three disciples, who have thrown themselves to the ground in prayer. On the left, Christ is climbing the mountain with the three disciples, while on the right we see the descent.",

    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Hermaphroditus and Salmacis.jpg": "In Gossart's painting the two figures stand in the water, Hermaphroditus trying to resist her embrace, while in the left background, the uniting couple is depicted.",
    "images/STARNINA, Gherardo di Jacopo/St Hugh of Lincoln and St Benedict of Nursia.jpg": "Judging from the angle at which the saint at right is standing, it probably served as the right wing, as the saint seems to be turning to the central scene of the corpus. The two saints are standing on a golden carpet or gold brocade, achieved by sgraffito technique, and against a gilded background. The bishop saint, identified as St Hugh of Lincoln (1135-1200), one of the first Carthusian saints, is dressed in pontificals and a mitre, holding a crozier in his left hand and raising his right hand in a blessing gesture. He is wearing a white Carthusian cloak and a mantle made of ultramarine blue with a pattern of golden crosses and a green border with plant ornamentation punched into the surface of the painting, which gives the dress a plastic texture. The saint to the right is one of the most important saints for the entire monastic community, St Benedict of Nursia (480-543) is holding a book in his left hand and a birch rod in his right, common attributes in other depictions of this saint.",

    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The School of Athens (detail).jpg": "Below the tondo on the vault representing Philosophy, ancient philosophers have assembled in the School of Athens. In the centre Plato and Aristotle carry books they have written: Timaeus and Ethics, respectively. With his outstretched hand Aristotle is presumably alluding to his mastery of natural phenomena. On the steps in front of Aristotle rests the Cynic philosopher Diogenes, with the cup that he tossed away.",
    "images/MARTINO DA VERONA/Annunciation and Saints.jpg": "In Verona, a group of frescoes consists of three frescoes having the Annunciation as their subject, depicted on the triumphal arch of San Zeno, in Santissima Trinità and in the left transept of Santo Stefano.",
    "images/SEITER, Daniel/Ceiling of the Galleria del Daniel (south section).jpg": "The centre picture on the ceiling is framed by two tall ovals in which Seiter depicted Apollo in Triumph over Night, and Venus on a Triumphal Chariot. Cartouche-shaped monochromes link the heavy gold frames of the ovals with the border area. The present photo shows the oval in the south section of the ceiling. It represents Venus on a Triumphal Chariot, below her Pax, Justitia, and Abundantia.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in Heaven.jpg": "The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic. The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi. The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Meeting of Antony and Cleopatra.jpg": "The arrival of Antony and his entourage is staged as an illusionistic vista within a feigned architectural framework. While the sails of the Roman fleet can still be glimpsed in the background, the magnificently costumed figures move off towards Cleopatra's palace in the manner of a triumphal procession. In the foreground, Antony and Cleopatra lead the way, already portrayed as a couple. Tiepolo ironically plays around with different levels of reality by having Antony point to the entrance of the palace, which is at the same time the room in which the viewer stands, and to which the steps in the picture also seem to lead down.",

    "images/BIJLERT, Jan van/Girl Teasing a Cat.jpg": "A child teasing a cat is a frequent subject in Dutch art; it refers to the idea that (sexual) teasing can lead to a painful scratching. That this mischievous girl is partially disrobed makes the consequences more obvious and erotic-since her bared skin teases the viewer as well.",

    "images/PRETI, Mattia/Aeneas, Anchises and Ascanius Fleeing Troy.jpg": "Abandoning his earlier predilection for genre scenes set in a closed room with artificial light, Preti is for the first time attempting a forceful history picture in an open, outdoor setting. The vibrant blue of Aeneas' mantle, the yellow of his tunic and the resplendent white of the drapery that covers Ascanius remind us that Preti had already encountered the art of Poussin and the neo-Venetian ambient in Rome. With his son Ascanius at his side, he carries his old and infirm father Anchises on his shoulders. Anchises clutches the penates, the household gods.",
    "images/FERRARI, Luca/View of the transept hall.jpg": "The selected theme was episodes from the life of Antenor, the mythological founder of the city of Padua. The scenes are displayed on the walls of the vast place in four large compartments. The dado below the compartments, painted in faux marmorino, circles the perimeter of the room. Interspersed with the painted scenes are depictions of the Virtues (Prudence, Nobility, Eloquence, and Kindness), set in illusionistic niches.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen.jpg": "The second scene is restricted to a narrow field on the left of the central predella panel, bounded by the green curtain. Lucy's fiancé, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel. At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fiancé assists the panders in their fruitless efforts. The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella.",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/View of the vault.jpg": "At the bottom of the picture shown here the prophets in the embrasure of the entrance arch can be seen.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Girl with a Pearl Earring.jpg": "This charming portrait of a girl is unfortunately in a very poor state of conservation and suffered from numerous extensive restorations. It is furthermore marred by an ugly pattern of cracks. The girl is seen against a neutral, dark background, very nearly black, which establishes a powerful three-dimensionality of effect. Seen from the side, the girl is turning to gaze at us, and her lips are slightly parted, as if she were about to speak to us. She is inclining her head slightly to one side as if lost in thought, yet her gaze is keen. The girl is dressed in an unadorned, brownish-yellow jacket, and the shining white collar contrasts clearly against it. The blue turban represents a further contrast, while a lemon-yellow, veil-like cloth falls from its peak to her shoulders. The girl's headdress has an exotic effect. A particularly noticeable feature of Vermeer's painting is the large, tear-shaped pearl hanging from the girl's ear; part of it has a golden sheen, and it stands out from the part of the neck which is in shadow. There is surely a similar explanation for the Head of a Girl dressed in a smart, grey dress (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).",

The book lying next to him refers to his translation of the Bible, and the red cardinal s hat hanging from a branch to his sacred office.",
    "images/WIJNEN, Domenicus van/The Witches' Sabbath by Moonlight.jpg": "At the left of the composition, a woman accompanies an adolescent, who seems unable to see her. She holds a book in one hand and a stick in the other. A lion, symbol of courage, stands next to her naked feet. Evil spirits, a demon holding a mirror off to the right, and the Devil, in the form of an old woman on a goat that dominates the scene, all feature. A pact has seemingly been made with the Devil: the protagonist has sold his soul for eternity, in exchange for a temporary allocation of his power. The central scene represents, in all probability, the Devil himself who comes to claim the soul of the hanged man, which passes through a ring - symbol of eternity - placed above the gallows. Other elements holding traces of sorcery are represented here: the fire in the centre of the scene, a symbol of physical, moral and mystical transmutation. Close to the fire we find a cat, servant of the underworld, as well as a sleeping baby, often victims of sorcery.",

These are enriched by the rich and suffused brown tones of the figures in the middle ground and the almost monochromatic rendering of the figures at the right.",

    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Hunters in the Snow (detail).jpg": "The principal motif of the painting is a group of hunters, seen from behind, bringing their catch to a village lying farther down. Their movement leads the eye over the wide winter landscape to the tiny figures sporting on the ice and the snowcapped mountains on the distant horizon.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/St Elizabeth Giving Bread and Wine to Beggars.jpg": "The other - interior - side depicts the Adoration of the Christ Child. The painting shows the influence of Gothic art which was still present in German religious art at the beginning of the 16th century.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Portrait of the Merchant Georg Gisze.jpg": "The merchant is depicted standing in his workroom, behind a table covered with a richly embroidered cloth. From the shelf in the top right-hand corner several keys, signet-rings and a spherical container are hanging, the latter presumably containing string. On the table is a pewter writing-stand with goose-feathers, ink, sand, wax disks and sealing-wax. Beside it are a pair of scissors, a signet-ring and a seal. Near the table's edge, precisely placed in the centre foreground, stands a small table-clock which, together with the fragile glass vase and the perishable flowers, is a reminder of the passage of time, as was the hour-glass in earlier pictures.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Perugia Altarpiece (in modern frame).jpg": "The picture shows the Perugia Altarpiece in a modern, early twentieth-century frame. The diverse saints on the pilasters, almost all bearing books, reflect the commitment to scholarship by the Order that shared by the Guidalotti.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The subject of this famous portrait - formerly thought to be a self-portrait - is an unknown young man looking up from his book. Daylight enters as if through a high and narrow window on our left. Brilliant on the gathered shirt, reflections from which define the curve of the jaw and the twist of the neck, it casts deep shadows on the eye sockets, smoulders in the dark eyes, shapes the skull under the triangular hat, lends mobility and colour to the distinctive features.",
    "images/JUAN DE FLANDES/Herodias' Revenge.jpg": "Herod and Herodias sit at a table in a Renaissance interior. Salome presents the severed head of John the Baptist to them on a platter. Herod recoils from the atrocity, but Herodias holds a knife ready to pierce John's tongue in revenge for the saints's denunciation of her sinful behaviour. Each wing consisted of at lest two panels placed one on top of the other. The bright lighting and accentuation of the green, red and orange sections generate a nervous tension. Placing the main protagonists in the foreground lends the scene an expressive aura and a pronounced monumentality, which is further heightened by the dramatic movement, the sharply delineated forms and the realistic appearance of the figures.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Cortona Polyptych (central panel).jpg": "On the left panel St John the Evangelist and St John the Baptist, on the right panel St Mark and St Mary Magdalen are depicted. The ten predella pictures show episodes of the life of Saint Dominic and standing figures of saints.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna).jpg": "In the impressive Madonna in Red - also known as the Durán Madonna, after a former owner - there is an architectural niche very like the portals of the altarpiece, again with an angel hovering with a crown at the apex. In her red robe, glowing with an unreal light, and framed in a sculptural niche, the Virgin appears withdrawn and majestic, though her loving attention to her son and the rough, childish way he is leafing through the book are very human touches in themselves.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Portrait of Hans Luther (detail).jpg": "Cranach portrays Hans Luther. the successful 68-year-old entrepreneur as an assertive, rather mischievous person who is rightly pleased with what he has achieved.",
    "images/MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban/The Holy Family with a Bird.jpg": "Here the Holy Family is portrayed as a simple human family: the artist shows a carpenter and his wife as he might have seen them at home in seventeenth-century Spain, dressed in the costume of the day. There is an element of sentimentality in the scene: the parents watch fondly as the Child plays with the dog and the bird.",
    "images/DIJCK, Abraham van/Isaac Blessing Jacob.jpg": "The large figures, the colour scheme of red and gold and the dramatic chiaroscuro are very much in line with Rembrandt's late style.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Lucretia.jpg": "In most paintings of this subject Lucretia is nude, which gives a sly erotic undertone to the situation, but Rembrandt shows her robed to the neck in fine clothes, like the noblewoman she was. In the picture, she has already driven the dagger into herself and has pulled it out, and the blood seeps through her dress. Although her body remains upright she lurches sideways from the hips as she clutches the bell-rope, and her face has the pallor of approaching death. The motif of the hand clasping the tasselled rope, however, is a reminder of the common studio practice whereby a model posing with his or her arm raised would support it by means of a rope or sling.",

    "images/RIBERA, Jusepe de/Jacob's Dream.jpg": "Instead, the dream is suggested merely by vaporous, golden figures who might almost be part of the real sky. But the setting of the dreamer, and the play of light on his sleeping face, impart a portentous and mysterious mood to the scene.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Polyptych.jpg": "The polyptych consists of five panels and a predella. In the central panel the Madonna sits on a Gothic throne flanked by St Peter, the Archangel Gabriel, the Archangel Michael and St Paul.",

He points to the stone in the foreground from which his Spring will be carved in 1712, its model to the left.",
    "images/ZUCCHI, Jacopo/The Gods of Olympus with Hercules and the Muses.jpg": "In fact, it depicts the gods of Olympus with Hercules and the Muses. Zucchi depicts him perched high in the sky, delivering to Juno the attributes that identify her as the queen of Olympus. The goddess of Justice, Astrea, and Mercury, messenger and cup-bearer of the gods, figure on the sides of the couple. At the bottom, as if in a sort of encyclopaedia of mythology, a theme particularly close to the painter's heart, given his in-depth knowledge of mythography, the other divinities of Olympus flaunt their respective attributes.",
    "images/MASOLINO da Panicale/The Baptism of Christ.jpg": "In the upper, semicircular panel of the east wall of the Baptistery, the scene representing the Baptism of Christ is depicted. Although the picture is divided into three separate settings, the connecting rock formations make it clear that we are witnessing a single event, where the baptism of both Christ and the neophytes in the Jordan are combined in a single composition. The Christ figure, which dominates the picture, stands knee-deep in the river's green waters, which snake forward out of the depth of the picture. To the right of John, who is administering baptism, are four men preparing for their own baptism by stripping off their clothes. The animated poses of the two men clad only in their undergarments show Masolino's mastery of human anatomy, doubtless acquired through life drawing. In the barrel vault, God the Father appears in a circular opening.",

    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/Baptism of Christ.jpg": "At the centre, the figure of Christ is portrayed as a simple man, but his stance is so solemn as to make him look as majestic as a Greek god. His torso and his legs are circular and solid, like the tree on the left; the holy dove, like a little cloud, fits into a patch of sky amidst the foliage of the tree, rendered with almost Impressionistic strokes. The three angels on the left, with their pale but round faces, are reminiscent of the groups of children sculpted by Luca della Robbia for the Cantoria in Florence Cathedral (1432-38): and even their blonde hair, decorated with garlands, is clearly inspired by Luca's models. The face of the angel in the centre, with his fixed gaze, brings to mind Domenico Veneziano paintings in the mid-1430s.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Creation of Eve (detail) (1).jpg": "In response to the gesture and intense gaze of the Creator, Eve appears to rise from the rocks behind Adam rather than from his body, extending her joint hands.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Adoration of the Magi (3).jpg": "An intimation that the picture was perhaps done during Botticelli's stay in Rome can be seen in the groom in the background on the right who is attempting to bring his horse under control; Botticelli probably adapted this motif from the classical sculptures of the Dioscuri, the horse-tamers, in Rome. As in the Adoration done for Guasparre del Lama, those present here are arrayed around the Virgin in a semicircle; in this picture, however, Botticelli has opened up the semicircle towards the observer, so that the latter's gaze may reach the Virgin unhindered. At the same time, all those involved, their postures and gestures, are directed towards the Mother of God, lending the painting a dramatic unity which the earlier Adorations lacked.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Singing Angels (detail) (2).jpg": "In the upper part of the polyptych there are two pictures depicting angels singing and playing music. Their ornamental clothes, painted with painstaking detail, and their natural appearence increase the power of this tremendous vision.",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 1 Scenes from the Life of Joachim 1. Rejection of Joachim's Sacrifice.jpg": "The elderly Joachim is denied entry to the temple, as he has remained childless. The architecture reinforces the priest's gesture of rejection, to which the saint replies with a saddened look. The sheep, as a sacrificial animal that has become superfluous, has a particularly touching effect. The action is also driven forward by the repetition of buildings.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/At the Races in the Countryside.jpg": "The photographs showed that traditional English prints were inaccurate when depicting galloping horses with their front legs outstretched. The race itself is in the background, the foreground is occupied by a family scene centred on a baby, with the nurse, mother, father and even the dog atop the box. The family is the Valpinçon family: the driver of the carriage is Degas's friend Paul Valpinçon, who is shown with his wife, a wet nurse, and in the nurse's lap, the couple's son, Henri. The people in the carriage are caught in their fashionable elegance.",
    "images/MASSYS, Cornelis/Arrival of the Holy Family in Bethlehem.jpg": "Shown after having been turned away from the inn, the Family's presence seems almost incidental to such a loving delineation of landscape.",

    "images/BERGOGNONE, Ambrogio/St Catherine of Alexandria.jpg": "The aristocratic appearance of this female figure is based entirely on the circling patterns of the robe, which builds up an ogee form embracing vibrant spatial rhythms. These are most marked in the arm, the wheel and the somewhat heavily rendered drapery. The well-mannered monumentality is enhanced by the yellow colour. In the embroidery of the bodice the yellow has the quality of a goldsmith's work; it ripples as if there were a slight movement in the air.",

The skilfully constructed perspective is perfectly co-ordinated with the precisely drawn and coloured figures.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Ceiling decoration (1).jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling decoration of the stairwell in the Palazzo Patriarcale. The stairwell, which is well-lit and has steps climbing around an open shaft three stories tall, serves as an imposing approach to the patriarch's suite. Tiepolo painted its ceiling with a striking Fall of the Angels framed by eight monochrome scenes from the Genesis - from the creation of Adam to the expulsion from Paradise.",
    "images/ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe/The Librarian.jpg": "This portrait depicts an old man composed largely of books piled one above and against each other. An open book on top of his head forms his hat. The figure is held together by a cloak shaped from the drapery in the background. The librarian has been interpreted as a portrait of Wolfgang Lazius, a learned collector and scientist who was in charge of the Emperor's Kunstkammer and who arranged his numismatic collection and his library.",

    "images/CARAVAGGIO/St John the Baptist at the Well.jpg": "A Banner with writing on it, which is wound around the unusually well-defined Jacob's staff on the ground, has an inscription which, although the artist twists it skilfully, can easily be read as: AGNUS DEI, the lamb of God.",

While playing, a boy falls out of the windows of the Palazzo Spini. A red ball falling to the street below him. Some passers-by see the falling child, rush up in help, but it is too late: the child is dead. The boy who met with the fatal accident is already lying on a bier surrounded by mourners.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ancestors of Christ figures (5).jpg": "The figures are in the triangular spandrel in the fourth bay between the Cumaean Sibyl and Isaiah. The spandrel is situated over the Hezekiah-Manasseh-Amon lunette. All of the space in the foreground is occupied by the figure in profile of the woman seated on the ground. Behind her, there is the figure of a child and the head of an old man emerging from the shadows. A bright light, however, gives prominence to the woman's green mantle with iridescent yellow shadows, her white shirt, and the violet scarf falling from her shoulder along her right arm, heightening the contrast with the figures behind.",
    "images/MANET, Edouard/Luncheon on the Grass (Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe).jpg": "The rowboat in the background and the fine still-life of discarded garments and picnic things both refer to Courbet's painting.

His women are placed on a level with his horses and dogs.",
    "images/GUERCINO/Ceiling painting (detail) (6).jpg": "In the Stanza del Caminetto, a room adjacent to the central room on the ground floor, the centre of the ceiling shows a wreath of putti, the documented work by Antonio Circignani, called il Pomarancio (1560-1620). It is framed by four landscape pictures painted by Paul Bril, Giovanni Battista Viola, Domenichino, and Guercino.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Last Judgment (detail) (1).jpg": "The artist's self-portrait appears twice in the Last Judgment: in the flayed skin which Saint Bartholomew is carrying in his left-hand, and in the figure in the lower left hand corner, who is looking encouragingly at those rising from their graves. The present picture shows St Bartolomew and the flayed skin. In the middle of the Last Judgment fresco on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, to the right beneath Christ the Judge, our eye is drawn to the place where the apostle and martyr St Bartholomew is displaying his attributes. In his right hand he is holding the knife with which, as legend had it, he was skinned alive; in his left, he is holding the skin itself, including that of the face, with its tortured folds and demonic hollows. In the Pietà in Florence, the figure of Nicodemus, who is holding the body of Jesus, just taken down from the Cross, close to his breast in sorrow, is probably also a hidden self-portrait.",
    "images/FAGAN, Robert/Portrait of Lady Emma Hamilton as Neapolitan Peasant.jpg": "Here he shows her in a calmer pose. Emma, with a knowing smile on here face, takes on a more humble, if equally seductive part. She is shown here in the brightly coloured costumes of the south of Italy.",

El Primo is portrayed leafing through the pages of an enormous tome. His small size makes the books surrounding him appear even more gigantic than they are.",
    "images/CAVALLINI, Pietro/Last Judgment (detail) (5).jpg": "Angels, whose bright, colourful feathers stand out against the dark blue ground of the fresco, frame the mandorla.

A haggard Cain is doggedly leading his tribe. On the wooden stretcher carried by his sons sits a bewildered woman with her dazed children. Chunks of bleeding meat are hung on the stretcher. Other men, the hunters, are trudging alongside. One is carrying a young woman in his arms and stray dogs bring up the rear.

    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Adoration of the Lamb.jpg": "The central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood. To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.",
    "images/ROMANESQUE PAINTER, Italian/St. Helena.jpg": "The frescoed lunette shows St Helena within a triumphal arch. Below the heads of Sts John, Peter, Thomas and Martius are depicted.

In the background the silhouette of the city is visible, and in the foreground St Mark, the patron saint of Venice, appears opposite the Doge.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/St Ursula Shrine (1).jpg": "The carved and gilded shrine in the form of a small church containing the relics of St Ursula is decorated with paintings on all four sides. The two lateral sides each feature three scenes from the life of St Ursula, while the two narrower ends show the saints and the 11,000 virgins, the Virgin and Child and the donors. Memling was clearly familiar with Cologne at first hand, as demonstrated by his accurate portrayal of the city skyline in the background, showing the unfinished cathedral, the distinctive tower of Great St Martin's church and, on the left, the church of St Cunibert. On the other side, the ships are sailing towards the north, running along the right bank as they advance downstream, and thus the city is to their left.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Supplemental scene (detail) (2).jpg": "The two female servants with the dog are typical secondary figures, used time and again by Tiepolo in numerous works to enrich the main action. The one to the fore is in half shadow, the one behind brilliantly lit, thus creating a spatial gradation.",

    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/View of the Chapel.jpg": "It comprises an almost square main room and, one step higher, an equally nearly square chancel. The two are separated from each other by two Corinthian pillars. The ceiling is decorated by a diamond-pointed ring in a halo with a loop that bears the motto of Piero de' Medici, semper, and within it inside a glory the monogram of Christ, JHS, as used for St Bernardino of Siena. The Procession of the Magi extends across the east, south and west walls of the main room above the encircling benches. The east wall leads off with the youngest king, the story continues on the south wall with the middle king, and ends on the west wall with the oldest king. The Procession of the Magi moves towards Filippo Lippi's altar painting of the Adoration of the Child. In the torch and candlelight that illuminated the room, the shining gold and metal layers on the paintings must have had a powerful effect. The empty section of wall above the new door now contains a landscape in the style of Benozzo.",
    "images/GEERTGEN tot Sint Jans/Virgin and Child.jpg": "This small painting of the Madonna depicts a fragile female figure holding her newborn together with a vanquished dragon. The artist indicates her floating, vision-like quality with the use of fantastic lighting and an army of angels in concentric circles. By arranging the choir of angels in a manner reminiscent of spheres, it is also expressed that the infant Jesus in the centre of the picture is the ruler of the Universe. With a sweeping gesture and a look of concentration, the infant is shaking two bells, as if to be in concert with the angel doing the same thing on the left side of the picture. They are definitely looking at each other, and since they are the only two doing this, the action has special significance: it shows the \"conductor\" Jesus in the role of the universe's prime mover. The inner circle contains six-winged cherubs and seraphs. The angels of the second circle hold above the head of Mary the early Christian symbols of glorification, scrolls with the word \"Sanctus\" appearing on them three times. The rest bear the objects associated with the Passion: the cross, the crown of thorns, a spear, nails, a hammer, and a column. The outside circle presents a multitude of musical angels, symbolizing heavenly happiness. Here we can see nearly all of the instruments of the period: lutes, violas, double recorders, trumpets, drums, bells, horns, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies, etc. The larger keyboard instruments are located in the corners; on the organ we can see the hand-operated bellows.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Zacharias Writes Down the Name of his Son (detail).jpg": "The bathed and swaddled baby John has been carried by a young maid across to his old father, Zacharias, who is forced to write down the name of his son as at the annunciation the angel struck him dumb until the birth of his son. Old men are leaning forward in order to read the name.. The extensive landscape in the background shows a town with a harbour in which a ship at anchor is clearly visible.",
    "images/DOMENICHINO/The Cumaean Sibyl (1).jpg": "The figure is depicted with a viola da gamba and a music book, because traditionally in antiquity sibyls sang their prophecies to the accompaniment of musical instruments.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/The Capture of Christ.jpg": "In the predella that Signorelli probably painted with the help of his assistant, Gerolamo Genga, four scenes from the Passion of Christ are represented: The Prayer in the Garden; The Last Supper; The Capture; The Flagellation. This picture shows the scene of the Capture.",
    "images/PINO, Marco/Scenes from the Life of Alexander the Great (7).jpg": "The six scenes of the Alexander cycle on the ceiling continues on the five large areas of the long walls. Alexander the Great Reconciles Two Soldiers  5. Alexander the Great Erects Altars  The picture shows the last scene of the cycle: Alexander the Great Erects Altars. It relates to Alexander's domination of the world: it shows him erecting the altars with which he marked the easternmost point in his train of conquest. A small but significant detail, namely the eagle and the Capitoline wolf on the front side of the first altar at right, invites us to recognize in the empire of Alexander the forerunner of the Roman empire",
    "images/MÁNYOKI, Ádám/Self-portrait.jpg": "In his charmingly confident craftsman-portrait he depicts himself at work, holding a palette and brushes in his hand, wearing a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, opening over his chest. In a trick of self-portraits popular since Rembrandt, the soft velvet hat with its upturned rim casts a warm brown shadow over the upper half of his face. Those warm reddish-brown half-shades and the tonal richness of the eyes' area modelled with reflexive lights and kept in shadow represent here a completely new, relaxed pictorial quality as compared to Mányoki's painstaking formation of details made by almost drawing with his brush.",

    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Virgin and Child.jpg": "Neither the facial type nor the weak, doll-like structure bears witness to his hand. And the golden background with dark clouds is reminiscent of the wings with an Angel with an olive-branch and an Angel with a sword (Paris-London).",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Christ Resurrected.jpg": "Christ looks a bit like Rubens, representing the artist's desire to resemble his saviour.",
    "images/SASSETTA/The Stigmatisation of St Francis.jpg": "As far as its original appearance can now be reconstructed, this great Franciscan altarpiece, like Duccio's Maestà in Siena Cathedral, showed the Madonna and Child enthroned in the front main tier facing the congregation in the nave. The back, facing the friars in the choir, depicted Saint Francis Triumphant standing on Insubordination, Luxury and Avarice and surrounded by eight smaller scenes from his life ranged in two tiers on either side. It shows one of the key events of Francis's life, cited in the process of his canonisation: the impression on his body of the five wounds of Christ. Giotto had already depicted Saint Francis in the same pose, kneeling and raising his arms to the six-winged seraph-Christ. Mountain shadows darken the stuccoed façade of the chapel, with its Virgin and Child above the door; Saint Francis's cord belt casts a shadow on his habit, and his parted fingers on the ground behind his shoulder. The miracle - which has caused the wooden cross in the makeshift oratory to bleed and makes of Francis an 'alter Christus,' a second Christ - is felt throughout the natural world, a red sunset staining the Umbrian hills.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Adam (detail) (1).jpg": "At the far left and right of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round.",
    "images/MONET, Claude/Riverside Path at Argenteuil.jpg": "According to which way he chose, the trees cluster as verticals at the left or right edge, their shadows n the path parallel horizontals.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants.jpg": "The second scene in the chronological order of the narrative, the Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the eighth bay, between the triangular spandrels. In this scene the figure of the Lord appears twice: on the right, as he is about to give shape, with his outstretched arms, to the incandescent disk of the sun and the cold one of the moon; and, on the other side, as, with an imperious gesture, he summons forth tufts of grass and the first bushes from the bare earth. The scene is divided unequally: the great disk of the sun - the only element of colour that stands out clearly from the more subdued tones of the clothes, flesh, and the greyish white background of the sky - is to the left of the central axis of the field, and the whole of the right part is dominated by the figure of the Creator who, surrounded by four children, moves impetuously toward the viewer. On the left, in a more restricted field, and further back from the picture plane, the Creator is depicted once again - notably foreshortened and seen from behind - as he heads toward the earth, going away from the foreground.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Infanta Doña María, Queen of Hungary.jpg": "Every detail, for instance the typically protuberant Habsburg lower lip, shows a striking similarity to the living model. The delicate carmine of her lips, the beautiful Titian shade of her hair, depicted in relaxed brushstrokes with dark brown shadows and bright yellow highlights, all display the artistic skill now at the command of Velázquez in his harmonious combination of state splendour with the individuality of his sitter.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Land of Cockaigne (detail) (2).jpg": "You must eat your way through a mountain of porridge to reach the land of Cockaigne, the proverbial \"land of milk and honey\". There, the fences are made of sausages, the geese lie ready-grilled on the plates, the pigs bring knives with them, and what one might take to be cacti are in fact made of oatcakes.",
    "images/DAVID, Ludovico Antonio/Adoration of the Shepherds.jpg": "They are painted with rich colours and turbulent rhythms, in the manner of the much-acclaimed Death of St Francis Xavier by Giovanni Battista Gaulli (known as Baciccio) in the same church.",
    "images/BOUTS, Dieric the Younger/The Adoration of the Magi.jpg": "This picture shows the central panel of a beautiful small altarpiece which is called \"The Pearl of Brabant\". The left wing represents St John the Baptist, while the right wing St Christopher.",
    "images/OEVER, Hendrick ten/Canal Landscape with Figures Bathing.jpg": "In the middle distance of this landscape with sunset effect is a river, with several groups of nude bathing figures. A distant view of Zwolle is on the horizon.",
    "images/BARTOLO DI FREDI/Scenes from the Old Testament.jpg": "The picture shows four scenes from the Old Testament, located in the fourth bay of the south aisle. The scenes are: The Departure of Abraham and Lot (above left), Abraham and Lot Separate (above right), God and Satan Agree on the Temptation of Job (below left), Sabeans and Chaldeans Kill Job's Servants.",
    "images/VERNET, Horace/The Duke of Chartres on Horseback.jpg": "The painting depicts the Duke of Chartres, after hoisting the Tricolour to the top of the Vendôme Column on the 4th August, 1830. Chartres, at the head of his regiment, hoisted the tricolour flag to the top of the Vendôme column, in the centre of the splendid Place designed by Mansart. Here we see the young Duke in his Guards uniform mounted on his rearing charger, looking straight at the viewer, his officers behind and in the distance the towering colonnade.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Entombment of Christ.jpg": "Its influence is evident in the display of the dead man, shown almost standing, with Mary and John holding his arms one on each side, and more particularly in the hill with the tomb in the rock, which runs entirely counter to Northern European tradition.",
    "images/WOUWERMAN, Philips/Riding School.jpg": "The picture shown here depicts a scene of horse training with a mountainous landscape in the background. A company of horse trainers are seen in a woodland glade in the mountains breaking in horses. In this composition the figures of the riders, grooms and children, all clothed in bright colour, are no more important than the horses. The trees, billowing cumulus clouds and rather misty landscape suggest a more southerly setting than the place where this picture was in fact painted. The prancing movements of the saddled horses make this an exceptionally animated composition.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Personification of Justice.jpg": "To the sides of the ceiling in the grand staircase, four large, faux Palladian windows, half-hidden by groupings of clouds, hold two theologian virtues - Hope and Charity - and two cardinal virtues - Justice and Fortitude - all accompanied by their respective attributes. Hope, Charity and Justice are drenched in light, whereas Fortitude is in shadow. Justice is shown with the peacock of Pride, which falls, pierced by an arrow.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/The Fountain of Youth (detail) (6).jpg": "The jollifications at the festive table, the dancing, music and lovemaking, all take place in a lush flowering landscape.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Grand Canal from Santa Maria della Carità to the Bacino di San Marco.jpg": "In the central distance can be seen the dome of the Salute and the masts of a number of large ships moored in the Bacino, while at the right is the church of Santa Maria della Carità, which also features prominently in 'The Stonemason's Yard'. In addition he has created formal interest by carefully observing how the Scuola to the far right of the picture casts diagonal shadows across the façade of the church.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Burial of St Lucy.jpg": "The heavily-muscled grave-diggers emerge from murky shadows, the mourners are so much smaller that they seem placed some distance away, the officer directing operations beside the bishop is obscured and only the young man above the saint stands out poignantly in his red cloak. The scene takes the viewer back to the age of the Church of the catacombs.",
    "images/FRANCKEN, Frans III/Genre Scene.jpg": "A group of figures is around at a table laid with pate, oysters, roast chicken, citrus fruits and wine. Another group of figures is engaged in board games. The painting in the background depicting Danaë being visited by Zeus in the form of a shower of golden rain shows the erotic character of the scene.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/The Trials and Calling of Moses (detail) (2).jpg": "While Moses is looking after the sheep belonging to his stepfather, God appears to him in the burning bush and orders him to take off his shoes before approaching. Then he commands him to lead the children of Israel from Egypt into the Promised Land.",
    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/Decoration of a house (1).jpg": "The picture shows wall paintings from a house below the church of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura on the Via Appia.",
    "images/LE NAIN brothers/Milkmaid's Family.jpg": "The contrived combination of a monumental group standing on a hillock as if on a pedestal, with a majestic panoramic view unfolding behind, has a certain elevated pomp.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/St Ursula Shrine Virgin and Child.jpg": "The narrow sides of the chest portray St Ursula at one end, holding an arrow and protecting the holy virgins under her cloak, and the Virgin Mary at the other, with the Christ Child and two kneeling nuns. Both scenes are located in the interior of a Gothic chapel, painted in such a way as to suggest the interior of the reliquary.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/The Fountain of Youth (detail) (3).jpg": "Old peasant women are transformed into young ladies of the court who indulge in the carefree pleasures of life.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/The Flight into Egypt.jpg": "The restful setting, the gently undulating planes that extend to the distant horizon, and even the boat - a symbol of life - floating on a peaceful river in the foreground create a most unusual atmosphere, based on the effect of repetition.",
    "images/ABBATE, Niccolò dell'/Decoration.jpg": "Adjoining the Porte Dorée to the east is the vast Salle de Bal, designed by Sebastiano Serlio, and next to it in turn is the Chapelle St-Saturnin, on the site of the original medieval chapel. The photo shows the Salle de Bal (also called  Galerie Henri II) designed by Sebastiano Serlio (1541).",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/Blessed Agostino Novello Altarpiece (detail) (3).jpg": "Lower right scene of the altarpiece: Child Falling out of his Cradle.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Death of the Virgin (detail).jpg": "Christ holds up the animula, the soul of Mary who has just died.",
    "images/VELDE, Esaias van de/Winter Landscape.jpg": "The figures are sketched in sure, quick strokes, the landscape evoked in pigments thinly scraped across the still-visible gesso ground.",
    "images/KEYSER, Thomas de/Virgin Mary.jpg": "Since the Virgin and the Apostle have been portrayed as sculptures in a niche, in an architectural setting, the absent Christ would probably have been a statue.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Drusiana (detail) (3).jpg": "The detail shows a running youth from the grouping at left.",
    "images/DELAROCHE, Paul/Hemicycle (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows the right side of the painting.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Portrait of a Man, Possibly an Architect or Geographer.jpg": "In his hands the well-dressed and well-groomed gentleman holds a watch, an architect's or draftsman's square (defining a right angle), and a pair of dividers. Here the watch is held foremost, signifying that an awareness of one's mortality leads to a proper mode of life.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Woman Ironing.jpg": "It is a delicate, arresting portrait of an unknown woman seen in a fragrantly sketched setting of whites, greys and pale pinks.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Rembrandt and Saskia in the Scene of the Prodigal Son in the Tavern (detail).jpg": "This detail depicts the artist laughing, with wine glass in hand, in the company of a smiling courtesan.",
    "images/MACLISE, Daniel/A Scene from 'Undine'.jpg": "The priest, Father Heilmann, who has just performed the marriage ceremony, follows behind and is visible beneath the branch of the tree. Ahead is the dark and sinister apparition, Kuhleborn, the spirit of the waters and the uncle of Undine. Huldbrand draws his sword on Kuhleborn and then strikes him, whereupon the spirit of the waters is transformed into a waterfall. Clearly the painting illustrates the forces of good, represented by the newly married couple, overcoming the power of evil, symbolised by the looming figure of the water god. The narrative element of the picture is aligned on a diagonal, which is contained within a bower populated by elves, goblins and water-nymphs associated with the surrounding forest.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Polyphemus and Acis.jpg": "The fresco depicts the scene when the jealous Cyclops Polyphemus hurls a rock at Acis, the beloved of the sea nymph Galatea.",
    "images/GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de/The Miracle of St Anthony (detail) (1).jpg": "Behind the painted railing surrounding the cupola, Saint Anthony, in the presence of a Lisbon crowd, brings back to life a murdered man in order to establish his father's innocence of the crime. The placing of the principal scene of the miracle on the walls of the cupola usually occupied by a representation of heaven is unconventional, like the decoration of the walls below with female angels and painted curtains.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Summer.jpg": "The join on the left is on a line with the tall windswept trees, which seem to have been painted over the sky and therefore may be regarded as an adaptation of the original design, which most probably incorporated a clear view through to the horizon. On the right the design has been more radically changed as a result of the addition. The eye is plunged into the distance across a glorious landscape that is positively pantheistic in its celebration of nature (note the cow being mounted in the centre of the composition).",
    "images/BOUCHER, François/The Bath of Venus.jpg": "The focus of the composition of the Bath of Venus is the youthful and beautiful Venus, the soft contours of her figure highlighted against the rich greens and blues of the background. The youthful goddess is one in a long line of Boucher's female nudes.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Ceiling decoration (detail) (5).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the ceiling of the Sala del Collegio.",
    "images/STOOP, Dirck Willemsz/Landscape with Huntsmen.jpg": "The painting depicts a landscape with huntsmen preparing for the hunt, together with their hounds and horses, a stone bridge with figures nearby, with a fortified house in the background.",
    "images/BARTOLO DI FREDI/The Adoration of the Magi.jpg": "The only tranquil detail is Mary sitting with the Child on the right side. The three kings arrive with a big accompaniment from the left. The big striped hats in the hands of the members of the accompaniment is well known from the St Martin fresco cycle of Simone Martini in Assisi. The background scene is a reference to the long journey of the kings between cities and mountains. The walled city is Siena with the black and white striped Cathedral and the bell-tower.",
    "images/PARMIGIANINO/Diana and Actaeon (3).jpg": "It depicts the famous story told by Ovid of the hunter Actaeon, who happened innocently to catch sight of Diana bathing, was transformed into a stag by the enraged goddess, and eventually killed by his own dogs. The picture shows part of the mural frescoes with inscription.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, French/The Crucifixion of the Parlement of Paris.jpg": "The frame, forming five lunettes, recalls the compartments of a polyptych. However, the surface of the painting is occupied by a single, united landscape showing the Paris of the time.",
    "images/TENIERS, David the Younger/Peasants Dancing outside an Inn (1).jpg": "Peasants have gathered for a boisterous celebration outside a country inn. They are enjoying themselves, drinking and dancing to the sound of the bagpipes. On the other side of the wooden fence, homeward-bound revellers are already struggling with the consequences of too much drink, having to be held up or helped back onto their feet by their women companions.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Lady with a Unicorn.jpg": "The fullness of the well constructed figure is set apart from a vast landscape background, inspired by Leonardo but executed with the clarity typical of Raphael.",
    "images/GENGA, Girolamo/St Augustine Baptizes the Cathechumens.jpg": "It takes place in an interior laid out in precise perspective, with an all'antica baptismal font in its central axis. The naked figures move in the space vigorously. The viewer is particularly struck by the powerful musculature of the nudes disrobing in the foreground.",
    "images/EVERDINGEN, Caesar van/Lycurgus Demonstrates the Benefits of Education.jpg": "Seated in the market place, the king addressed the crowd assembled around him on the importance of a proper upbringing. He called his two dogs to demonstrate his point and placed before them a bowl of food and a live hare. One chased after the hare, but the other stopped to eat from the bowl. One has turned into glutton and the other a spirited hunting dog.' The latter is the animal licking the pot in the foreground, while the hunting dog stands beside Lycurgus and receives an approving pat on the head. The hare it has caught lies on the step at Lycurgus' feet.",
    "images/BECCAFUMI, Domenico/View of the Oratory.jpg": "In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Cardinal Virtues.jpg": "The lunette containing the Cardinal Virtues (which represent \"Good \") is built around an allegorical theme. Fortitude, dressed in armor, sits in the shade of an oak tree. Prudence is placed on the highest step of the base. She has two faces: one of a young woman who looks at her reflection in a mirror handed to her by a winged putto; the other, of an old man, the symbol of old age, of which prudence is the chief quality. Finally, Temperance is represented holding a pair of reins. Three winged genii symbolize the theological virtues (Charity, gathering the fruits of the oak; Hope, in the centre with a flaming torch; and Faith, at the extreme right, pointing toward the sky).",
    "images/MASTER of the Legend of Saint Lucy/Virgin of the Rose Garden.jpg": "In the foreground of the present painting the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child are seated with four female martyr-saints (Catherine, Barbara, Ursula, and Cecilia) in attendance. The courtly entourage is placed within an enclosed garden lined with roses, suggesting metaphorical associations with the paradise bower of the Song of Songs and the cult of the rosary. The carefully delineated city in the background can be identified as Bruges.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Madonna of the Rosary.jpg": "The saints at the left side are Dominic, Magdalene, Thomas Aquinas; at the right Clare, Peter the Martyr, Esperance. The 15 tondos in the background represent scenes of the life of Christ, they are (from the bottom left) the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, Circumcision, Jesus among the Doctors, Agony in the Garden, Flagellation, Crowning with Thorns, Road to Calvary, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, Assumption, Coronation of the Virgin.",
    "images/CÉZANNE, Paul/The Eternal Feminine.jpg": "A broad cross-section of male society pays homage to its naked idol, who is holding court under a white canopy in a room which looks out over the countryside. The female figure has been stripped of her individuality, and lies defenceless and exposed to the men's gaze; she is subject and object, exploiter and exploited all in one.",
    "images/LANCRET, Nicolas/Dance in a Pavilion.jpg": "The decorative pendants, Le Moulinet, and Dance in a Pavilion, are typical of Lancret's art, with women who are almost alarmingly unindividualized and men but a bit more identifiable.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Madonna and Child with the Pear.jpg": "Despite its small scale, the Madonna is depicted in a half-bust; the child is seated, though it is unclear on what - maybe the mother's arm. Here, too, the Madonna is frontally depicted, holding a pear in her left hand of which we see only the fingers. And here again, the long blond hair falls on her shoulders almost symmetrically to the right and left. The necklines of the white blouse and red dress are also nearly symmetrical, contrasting with her softly curved facial features. Her downward gaze shows meditation and pensiveness. Even the gaze of the clothed child is absorbed and immobile. The right hand holds on to the edge of the mother's cloak, and the left hand's fingers close around a nondescript flower.",
    "images/ARNULPHY, Claude/Admiral Thomas Mathews.jpg": "In the background is Hyères Bay, Toulon.",
    "images/ASAM, Cosmas Damian/Pentecost.jpg": "The fresco decorates the small cupola above the main altar.",
    "images/BRUYN, Barthel the Elder/Portrait of a Woman.jpg": "This painting and its companion picture show an unidentified couple at half-length. The woman's exposed hair indicates that the couple are depicted as engaged not married, as married woman of Cologne wore their hair completely covered.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/The Last Supper.jpg": "As in Leonardo's picture, in Holbein's version the back wall is pierced by three windows, with the central window being reserved for the figure of Christ; the position of heads and arms also corresponds to Leonardo's composition. In addition, the eye is not led through the window openings to a distant landscape; Holbein encloses the shallow pictorial space by an intense blue sky that looks completely ethereal. Jesus and his disciples sit at a narrow, covered table celebrating the Last Supper, but only nine of the twelve apostles are present.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Last Miracle and the Death of St Zenobius.jpg": "A child is run over by a cart while playing. His mother, a widow, wails as she brings the dead child to St Zenobius' deacon. On the far right, the bishop, who has meanwhile turned gray, blesses those praying by his deathbed.",
    "images/ZEITBLOM, Bartholome/Double Portrait of an Engaged Couple (detail).jpg": "Two lovers are represented in separate special planes, divided by a wall and window depicted with a primitive naturalism.",
    "images/MONTAGNA, Bartolomeo/Madonna and Child under a Pergola with St John the Baptist and St Onofrius.jpg": "The throne seems to have been carved out of the rock; the canopy, held up by thin saplings, awakens in the viewer the solemn calm of the sacred.",
    "images/PUVIS DE CHAVANNES, Pierre-Cécile/Hope (1).jpg": "In the wake of the catastrophic Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the artist painted this picture of a young woman seated in a devastated landscape holding an oak twig as a symbol of hope for the nation's recovery from war and deprivation.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/Theseus Finding His Father's Sword.jpg": "The scene shows the Greek hero Theseus lifting a great stone to which his mother Aithra has led him.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish/Two wings of an altarpiece.jpg": "These wings are the outside shutters of an altarpiece. They represent the St Elizabeth's Day floods of 1421 with the city of Dordrecht in the background.",
    "images/NEER, Aert van der/Skaters and Kolf Players on a Frozen River.jpg": "The picture shows skaters and kolf players on a frozen river bordering a village.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/Capture of Christ.jpg": "The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church. It is a scene of great drama and theatrical disposition, with the crowd rushing in from the rocks on the left and apostles fleeing on the opposite side. The moon disappearing behind the rocks is a moving touch.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/A Lady and Two Gentlemen (detail) (2).jpg": "The table features an exquisitely painted still life of a silver plate, fruit, and white pitcher.",
    "images/BOUTS, Dieric the Elder/Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "In contrast with the earlier representations of the coronation, in which the Virgin being crowned by Christ alone, here the crown is held by God the Father and God the Son, with the dove of the Holy Ghost hovering above.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Triptych of the Family Moreel (left wing).jpg": "The donors and their children are shown kneeling in the wings, in a landscape that extends from the central panel. The man is protected by St William of Maleval, the woman by St Barbara.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Banquet of Cleopatra.jpg": "Magnificent, brightly lit palace architecture is the setting for Cleopatra's banquet. It is therefore the sumptuous costumes, the magnificent receptacles and the rich variety of foods which draw most attention as they are proffered by the servants of the court, who include moors, a dwarf and a dog - a collection of elements typical of the work of Veronese.",
    "images/HEMESSEN, Jan Sanders van/The Surgeon.jpg": "A surgeon extracts a stone from a patient's head. The scene takes place in an urban setting, probably a market. An aged helper holds the patient's head, along with a youth, who prepares the unguents. Meanwhile, another patient grimaces grotesquely while waiting his turn. Hemessen criticizes the defrauding of patients by depicting the doctor with a sarcastic expression that reveals him as an impostor whose only interest is money.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Polyptych of the Resurrection Archangel Gabriel.jpg": "The detail shows the Angel of the Annunciation. The Archangel Gabriel (top left panel of the polyptych of the Resurrection) appears to be rushing in from the left, his garments streaming behind him. He spreads his greeting out on a banderole, which he is holding out to Mary on the opposite panel. His right hand, part of the banderole, his wings and the fluttering ends of his belt are all cut off by the edge of the picture. This creates the impression that the almost square panel is much too small to contain the magnificent figure of the angel.",
    "images/BEUCKELAER, Joachim/Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.jpg": "With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier.",
    "images/PIETERSZ., Pieter/The Three Young Men in the Blazing Furnace.jpg": "Three young men refused to kneel and the king had them cast into the fire.",
    "images/BASCHENIS, Evaristo/Agliardi Triptych (left).jpg": "The triptych includes portraits of the three brothers and a self-portrait of the artist playing instruments. The first picture of the triptych shows a musical performance, with the somber, middle-aged painter at the spinet and Ottavio Agliardi with an archlute. The table, sumptuously covered with a multicoloured carpet, bears the instruments of work and leisure: books, musical instruments (mandola, guitar, violone), a score, a piece of pear, all depicted with virtuoso foreshortening.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1).jpg": "The Calvary sequence takes place in the interior of a light, spacious church, whose carefully executed details immediately catch the viewer's eye. The seven sacraments are presented around the central crucifixion group accompanied by an angel with a banderole. Van der Weyden portrays him on the left of the painting, as the bishop administering Confirmation.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Ceiling decoration.jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling of the Sala Rossa (Sala del Tribunale) in the Palazzo Patriarcale. The proportions of the room were ill-suited for the design of an elaborate ceiling, therefore the painter divided the only slightly curving ceiling into a central panel surrounded by four satellites. The central panel depicts the Judgment of Solomon from an extremely low angle. In the irregularly shaped corner panels the prophets Isaah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel sit enthroned in solemn poses.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Landscape with Saint George and the Dragon.jpg": "Saint George and the Dragon symbolises the close relationship established between Rubens and the court of Charles I. The subject honours the patron saint of England and of the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III in 1348. On the left of the composition, for example, is the square church tower of St Mary Overy (now Southwark Cathedral) and to the right of this possibly the Banqueting House with Westminster Abbey before Hawksmoor's towers were added. Further down river on the right of the composition is an interpretation of Lambeth Palace. These drawings show that the horseman on the right was at first balanced on the left by a woman standing with a child, forms which can still be discerned between the trunks of the two trees and which are even more obvious by X-ray. The other elements of the composition, especially on the right, were merely rearranged on a broader scale.",
    "images/UGOLINO DI NERIO/Daniel.jpg": "The Prophet Daniel holds a scroll.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Christ before Pilate.jpg": "The central figure of Christ, shown in profile, is thin, frail and elongated. He is placed in opposition to the robust youth in the distance, higher on the vertical axis and in a much smaller scale.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/St Catherine of Alexandria.jpg": "Here we see a single female figure in an interior devoid of architectural allusions.",
    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/St Martin Renounces his Weapons (scene 4).jpg": "In this fresco we see Martin, as an officer in the Roman army face to face with the enemy, announcing his decision: \"I am a soldier of Christ and I cannot fight.\" To the left, the Roman camp, with Emperor Julian, a group of soldiers and the treasurer distributing money to the mercenaries. To the right, waiting for the battle, behind the hill, the barbarian army with their armour and their spears. Martin (still a knight, but carrying a cross and shown in the act of blessing) is looking towards the Emperor but walking towards the enemy. His battle is the struggle against paganism, and his only weapon is the word of Christ.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/Crucifix.jpg": "Christ is here represented just as he is drawing his last breath. On the sides the Virgin and St John are represented.",
    "images/BAILLY, David/Portrait of Anthony de Wale.jpg": "The sitter, holding a book in his right hand, was a professor of theology at the University of Leiden.",
    "images/LANCRET, Nicolas/Winter.jpg": "A group of figures are gathered in a refined drawing room; a fire lit in the background and fur-lined overgowns worn by the elegant ladies identify the season as winter. A card game is taking place at the table; some players are discussing strategy while others seem lost in thought, and the woman sitting at the center looks directly out at the viewer rather than at her hand. Two women nearby are reading a score while a third stands behind them, seemingly humming along. The young lady in the foreground entertains a kitten, while an older woman sits by the fire in the background, a small dog in her lap.",
    "images/KEYSER, Thomas de/Apostle St John.jpg": "Since the Virgin and the Apostle have been portrayed as sculptures in a niche, in an architectural setting, the absent Christ would probably have been a statue. St John is usually shown clean-shaven - here he has a moustache and goatee beard.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/San Giobbe Altarpiece.jpg": "A coffered vault is a perspective introduction to the composition, which is supported at the sides by pillars similar to the real sculpted ones of the altar. The pillars flank a deep niche, which with its shady penumbra amplifies the space behind the holy group.",
    "images/CLEVE, Joos van/The Suicide of Lucretia.jpg": "Lucretia is portrayed at three-quarter length with the upper body bared to reveal her breasts spilling from precious fabrics and with jewellery draped across her naked skin. The female figure convey an immediate impression of beauty and luxury. Characteristic features include the head leaning reflectively to one side and the way in which the hands clasp the handle of the dagger.",
    "images/GAUGUIN, Paul/Bonjour, Monsieur Gauguin.jpg": "Bruyas doffs his hat to the artist, and the servant stands with head respectfully lowered.",
    "images/DALEM, Cornelis van/Landscape with Shepherds.jpg": "The shepherd became element of pastoral scenes.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Two Scholars Disputing.jpg": "There were several earlier representations of this theme in art which show the two apostles as bearded scholars seated together, with one expounding a passage in a sacred book which the other holds on his knee.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Pope Leo X with Cardinals Giulio de' Medici and Luigi de' Rossi (detail) (1).jpg": "An illuminated manuscript (somewhat similar in style and period to the Queen Mary's Psalter) lies open on the table in front of Pope Leo. On the same table rests a finely carved bell. The velvets and damasks in their various rich tones add to the atmosphere of pomp and power.",
    "images/HOFMANN, Ludwig von/Daydream.jpg": "The painting shows Hofmann's bride Eleonore Kekulé (1878–1968), daughter of archaeologist Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz. The pure profile head is reminiscent of the beautifully lined female portraits of the Florentine Renaissance.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Allegory of Truth.jpg": "The sixteen allegorical figures around the central painting on the ceiling of the Sala dell'Albergo are portrayed in forced and artificial poses and attitudes of truly Mannerist origin. Truth twists her bust and every part of her body seems to spread out in the chromatic and luministic context.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/La Disputa (detail).jpg": "A segment of golden nimbus looms down from above, with God the Father and angels of the clouds occupying its lower edge. This wreath of clouds is repeated somewhat lower, with a larger radius, in the clouds thrones of the heavenly attendants. Between and in front of these two circles a gold disk moves forward, with Christ in the space it encloses. Below that, and even further forward, floats a smaller golden circle with the Dove of the Holy Spirit.",

    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/The Last Judgment (detail) (12).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the central panel. Beneath Christ stands St Michael, prince of the heavenly hosts. He is pictured as young, because he is immortal and as handsome, because he is the embodiment of divine justice. He holds in his hands a scale in which he weighs souls. The souls are represented by two little naked figures, whose names are \"Virtutes\" and \"Peccata\". The former kneels, overcome with delight, while the latter seems horrified and screams with terror.",

    "images/CAVAROZZI, Bartolomeo/St Ursula and Her Companions with Pope Ciriacus and St Catherine of Alexandria.jpg": "This is especially apparent in the figure of St Catherine of Alexandria, who raises one leg and holds her hand to her breast as she gazes upwards at the triangle containing the all-seeing eye of God. Pope Ciriacus, too, looks heavenwards. Behind St Ursula are a number of her one thousand followers. In contrast to Pomarancio's St Domitilla, Cavarozzi's St Ursula looks towards the viewer with an outstretched arm, presenting the Banner of the Cross. The hand with the banner is modelled on the work of Michelangelo and has its roots in his Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. With outstretched hand and bent forefinger, Christ beckons Matthew to follow him.",

    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Creation of Eve from Adam.jpg": "The banner, the front of which displays the tripartite deity flanked by Sts Sebastian and Roch, was commissioned in the town of Città di Castello by the Confraternity of the Holy Trinity. What had been the back view shows the Creator removing one of Adam's ribs, from which Eve will be brought forth. The sleeping, well-proportioned Adam, reclining in a graceful pose, is a particularly proficient treatment of the human form on the part of a young artist",

    "images/TINTORETTO/Portrait of Procurator Jacopo Soranzo (1).jpg": "Old Soranzo's white hair matches the fur trimming of his robe of office in both tone and artistic technique: marks of age and the insignia of power are closely connected in the gerontocracy of the Venetians. As the dominating element in the composition, the taut fur trimming continues the line of the strong-willed furrow between the brows.",

As he approached she threw over him a chasuble of heavenly origin. El Greco represent the patron saint of Toledo in full episcopal regalia, holding an elaborate gilt crosier through its green velvet sleeve wearing white kid gloves. He is wearing a spectacular chasuble  embroidered with floral arabesques and exotic birds, lined with pink silk, over a radiant white alb, and on his head an embroidered mitre. He reads a holy book with serious intensity while all around him the sky seems charged with high-voltage static. The saint is illuminated from the left, in contrast to the companion piece of St Peter, who is lit from the light.",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Franciscan Allegories Allegory of Obedience.jpg": "In the chapterhouse of a cloister Obedience rules between two observers, the dual-faced Prudence (Prudentia) and the quiet Humility (Humilitas). Obedience commands silence and places the yoke upon the monk who kneels before her. Francis, who stands on the roof of the building like an apparition between two kneeling angels, also bears such a yoke. The embodiment of Presumptuousness, the horned centaur, is denied entrance. Two young men, a monk of the order and a layman, will follow in the footsteps of the saint. An angel has already taken one of them by hand. She holds out a mirror, as a symbol of knowledge, towards the kneeling monk, whom the young men are following, and her astrolabe stands for the wider context which she is able to recognize.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Allegory of Poverty (detail) (2).jpg": "The rich man do not wish to know of the angels' demands that they follow St Francis. They cling to their sacks of money, and the elegant falconer mocks the heavenly messenger with an obscene gesture.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/The Madonna of the Carnation.jpg": "The main part of the space of the painting is occupied by the Virgin's head, encircled by a luminous halo against a dark green background. The perfect regularity of her face as seen from the front leads one to think that, like the Self-Portrait with Fur Coat of 1500 of Munich, this has been \"reconstructed\" according to precise laws of proportion. The Madonna's gaze - her eyes reflecting, like her child's, the window beside them - is not turned toward the spectator, but is directed into the distance. Even the child has a fixed gaze and is busy with a pear in his little hands, while the Madonna gracefully holds a stem of a carnation, with fruit and flower, between her fingers. Similar to the Madonna, who, for the rigid, formal composition of the head seems distant, almost rapt in an ideal world, so the child, with his wide-open eyes, who seems detached from his mother and the spectator. The small panel assumes the look of an icon, in which the carnation alludes to the Passion, and the pear that the child closes in his hands recalls - according to Saint Bonaventure - the sweetness of the wise of mouth and heart.",

However, the main subject of the painting is not the architecture but the picturesque scene of everyday life in the foreground.",
    "images/PARMIGIANINO/Three Foolish Virgins Flanked by Moses and Adam.jpg": "In the church Parmigianino transformed the broad barrel vault in front of the main apse into a sumptuous gilt, blue, and red field which seems to be bounded by protruding arches overlaid with interlacing gilt strapwork. Only the bosses at the centre of the coffers are actually three-dimensional, every other figure, niche, and decorative detail is a fiction. The three female figures performing a balletic balancing act on a fictive ledge carry empty lamps which characterize them as the unprepared Foolish Virgins of one of Christ's parables; their wise, mirror-image counterparts appear on the opposite side of the vault.",
    "images/ZOFFANY, Johann/Colonel Mordaunt's Cock Match.jpg": "The British and Indians, while carefully differentiated, appear as equals in the contest and Mordaunt's pointed Indian slippers show him adopting the local fashions.

    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Crucified Christ.jpg": "To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled.",
    "images/SALINI, Tommaso/Still-Life.jpg": "This is a still-life of a partridge, woodcock, woodpeckers, a pigeon, finches and other birds on a stone ledge with apples.",
    "images/VRIES, Roelof van/The Pigeon House.jpg": "The Pigeon House shows a few peasants going about their daily business, such as the fisherman who works in his boat, and the old lady going down to the river to meet him. On the edge of the bank is an old pigeon house, a run-down and dilapidated building. The painting shows a small corner of village life, focusing in and concentrating on the landscape, and is contextualized by the human activity that takes place within it.",
    "images/GONZÁLEZ VELÁZQUEZ, Antonio/Crucifixion with St Michael.jpg": "God the Almighty Father looks down upon his Son's crucifixion, St Michael slays the devil personified by a dragon, while a Saint prays before the Cross.",
    "images/USSI, Stefano/Expulsion of the Duke of Athens.jpg": "The scene is set in a room of the Bargello Palace, where the Duke, who had ruled despotically over Florence, is about to sign his resignation from government over the city. His expression matches the grim face of the perfidious councillor, Cerretieri Visdomini standing behind him, and also provides a contrast to the stationary attitudes of the characters on the left, identified as the figures behind the plot: Archbishop Acciaioli and representatives of the aristocracy and of the people. The ferment in the background culminates with the figure of the soldier on the right who, with his gestures, seems to urge the Duke to make this difficult choice, while through the window, it is possible to notice the celebrations already taking place in the city. Presumably some of the artist's friends posed for the main figures in the painting and the figure of the armiger with the bandaged head is Ussi himself.",
    "images/GERUNG, Matthias/Portrait of a Lady.jpg": "This portrait represents an unidentified lady, half-length, head in profile, wearing black with a white headdress, holding a book.",
    "images/ANDREA DA FIRENZE/Crucifixion.jpg": "In the centre of the small panel, Christ hangs on the cross, which is marked \"I.N.R.I.\" His head hangs onto his right shoulder and shows the marks from the crown of thorns, with blood oozing from his wounds. Mary stands to the left of the cross, her hands joined in a mournful gesture, gazing at her son. The figure of Saint John the Evangelist at the right is depicted in a slightly more active posture of mourning than the motionless Virgin. He has his hands joined in front of his chest, and his look toward Christ expresses sorrow and disbelief. A Dominican friar kneels at the foot of the cross, embracing it, while his lips appear to be kissing the feet of Christ. Two angels are at either side of the cross; they also mourn. The left angel has covered his face with part of his garment, and the right angel is supporting his head with his hand.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Lunette and Popes.jpg": "Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images (painted in the Quattrocento) of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.",
    "images/DOSSI, Dosso/Witchcraft (Allegory of Hercules).jpg": "He flushes the flesh tones of his characters with orangy, reddish colours, he places them in risqué situations, with bare-chested women in convivial surroundings and almost obscene merrymaking men with such highly characterized faces that they are almost caricatures. The faces of the women and that of the faun are drawn directly from a cultured classical tradition which is inserted into the Mannerist context. The other characters, emerging from a humid, obscure background, are anything but stereotypes: healthy faces reddened by feasting, grimaces, a variety of attitudes. The only note of light - quite unreal - which stands out from the prevalently ruddy tones, falls directly onto the breasts of the woman holding a bowl of fruit.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/The Virgin Showing the Man of Sorrows.jpg": "It is, in fact, a conflation of the Marian Pietà, in which the Virgin cradles her dead son in her lap, and the Trinity Pietà, in which God the Father holds the recently crucified Christ before him. Similarly, the Arma Christi in the background should be interpreted as signs of the Passion. Several emblems are included, in addition to obvious attributes such as the Cross, on which hangs the dark-purple robe from Christ's Mockery; the post from the flagellation with its rope, rods and flails; the cane and sponge, the spear, the hammer and nails. Looking from top to bottom, we see: on the left, Peter with Caiaphas' servant-girl, Judas with the purse around his neck, Annas and Caiaphas, the hand which struck Jesus, the fist that punched him, and another hand with closed fingers; on the right, Pilate and Herod, a hand making the obscene fica gesture, a head in profile (customarily one of the soldiers who mocked or spat at Christ), a hand that has pulled out some of Jesus' hair, and a stamping foot.",
    "images/GHEERAERTS, Marcus the Younger/Queen Elizabeth I ('The Ditchley portrait').jpg": "The portrait shows Elizabeth standing on the globe of the world, with her feet on Oxfordshire. The stormy sky, the clouds parting to reveal sunshine, and the inscriptions on the painting, make it plain that the portrait's symbolic theme is forgiveness.",
    "images/GRECO, El/Christ in Agony on the Cross.jpg": "The Christ in Agony on the Cross, with a view of Toledo.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Donor (1).jpg": "The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date.",
    "images/DOMENICO VENEZIANO/The Madonna and Child with Saints.jpg": "In the centre of a portico, in front of marble columns with boughs of orange trees protruding above, the Madonna and Child are surrounded by four saints, including the patron saints of Florence, John the Baptist and Bishop Zenobius, flanking the enthroned Virgin. The figures, posed naturally and at ease, create a \"sacra conversazione\" (holy conversation), a reinterpretation of the traditional theme of the Madonna and Child surrounded by saints depicted in Gothic polyptychs which became widely used in the fifteenth century as square or rectangular altarpieces became more common. The step of the dais where the Virgin Mary sits is signed by Domenico Veneziano, one of the greatest interpreters and innovators of the Florentine Renaissance, although records have always referred to the master painter as a native of Venice. The artist demonstrates his mastery of linear perspective with a central vanishing point conceived by Filippo Brunelleschi; the clear light entering from the right enhances the chromatic range of predominantly light tones and refines the shapes of the bodies, while their shadows cast on the floor are perfectly proportioned. The purity of the skin tones and the idealized beauty of the figures of the Madonna and Child and Saint Lucy - the latter holding a dish bearing her eyes which were gouged out during her martyrdom - contrast with the amber tones and worn faces of the three saints, respecting the iconographic models and aesthetic canons in vogue during the 15th century.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Frescoes in the fourth bay of the nave.jpg": "The walls on either side of the window are divided horizontally. At top, the Creation of the World can be seen on the left and the Creation of Adam (Jacopo Torriti) on the right. Below these are the Building of the Ark and the Boarding of the Ark (follower of Cimabue). On the walls of the nave we can see the first three stations in the life of St Francis. The illusionistic framework of the Legend of St Francis is also visible: the rich console frieze above the coffered ceiling, which is laid out in perspective and supported by twisted columns. The frescoes illustrate the complex decorative program realized in the nave of the Upper Church.",
    "images/VECELLIO, Francesco/The Miracle of the Miser's Heart.jpg": "In this scene on the end wall of the room, the heart of a deceased miser is found in his money chest, as the saint predicted. The miracle chastises the vice.",

    "images/DOMENICHINO/Cupola vault.jpg": "The centre of the chancel is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels.",
    "images/MASTER of the Lille Adoration/The Holy Kinship.jpg": "In this fragment, which has been sawn down on both sides and at the top, Joseph, St Anne and the Virgin and Child are grouped around a dish of fruit and surrounded by several male members of the family.",
    "images/COURBET, Gustave/Landscape with a Dead Horse.jpg": "The penetrating whiteness of the horse's corpse lying in the central foreground, contrasted with the sullen green of the forest behind, gives this provocative subject an elevated, almost religious inflection.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Meditation on the Passion.jpg": "One of the most beautiful of these paintings is this depiction of the Old Testament figure Job and of Saint Jerome as a hermit meditating on the body of the dead Christ. Numerous details underscore the theme of death and resurrection: the bones next to Job, the crown of thorns propped up against Christ's broken throne, the small bird that flies upward from Christ to symbolize the Resurrection. Even the lavishly painted landscape carries the theme by appearing desolate on the left and lush and open on the right.",
    "images/HONDIUS, Abraham Danielsz/Mercury and Argos.jpg": "Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. The inventive god (the Greeks called him \"Hermes dolios\", the schemer) approached the meadows, herding some goats which he had stolen along the way, and played songs on his pipe.",
    "images/ROMANESQUE PAINTER, Italian/The Miraculous Rescue of a Child.jpg": "The frescoes were commissioned by two members of the lay community, Beno di Rapiza and Maria Macellaria, who are identified by an inscription and are portrayed in the lower part of the scene with the miracle of the child found alive in a church at the bottom of the sea, close to St Clement , and together with their children. The miraculous event occurs under water and is given a lively rendering in the detailed depiction of various types of fish.",
    "images/MASTER of the Holy Blood/Lucretia.jpg": "In this painting Lucretia is a genteel Flemish bourgeois lady, who having undone her fashionable gown, grasp the dagger with both hands and stabs herself in the heart. This makes the muddy-green veil on her head start an elegant dance and the wide arms of the gown flutter gently.",
    "images/JACOMETTO VENEZIANO/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The present portrait shows a youth bust-length and in three-quarter view, his eyes gazing off to the left. He is clad in black and is set against a dark background. A distinctive feature is the arrangement of his hair.",
    "images/BIJLERT, Jan van/Shepherdess.jpg": "The present painting shows a shepherdess, half-length, wearing a large blue hat decorated with an iris and holding a staff. The painting has a pendant representing a shepherd with a flute (private collection).",

    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/St Columba Altarpiece (right panel).jpg": "The picture shows the Presentation in the Temple, the right panel of the altarpiece executed for the St Columba church in Cologne. He thanks God with the words, \"Lord, now lettest thou they servant depart in peace, according to thy word.\" The old prophetess Anna, who also recognizes the Christ, is standing behind Simeon. The servant behind Mary is holding two doves for the sacrifice of purification that followed childbirth.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/The Story of Lucretia.jpg": "The painting shows the death of Roman heroine, Lucretia, faithful, modest wife, raped by the last king of Rome, to whom she had given hospitality while her husband Collatinus was absent. In the left part of the panel, Lucretia is bloodless, with the knife in her chest, supported by her husband's embrace, while in the centre she is laid out on a catafalque for her funeral. The scene is set out of doors, in front of a column topped by the naked statue of an armed youth of uncertain identity. Among the crowd in the centre, Lucius Junius Brutus is approaching. Together with Lucretia's family, he will be seeking revenge for the woman, inciting the people of Rome to rise up, overthrow the king and proclaim the Republic.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/The Slaughtered Ox.jpg": "This picture, one of Rembrandt's most affecting paintings, shows the carcass of an ox hung up to bleed. While showing the details of the rack on which the butchered animal is hung and the condition of the carcass, it is not a clinical picture. The head of the woman peering tentatively into the space where the animal hangs introduces an element of questioning into the scene.",
    "images/LIBERALE da Verona/Virgin and Child (1).jpg": "This panel depicts the Virgin and Child before a green curtain with an open book.",
    "images/PIERO DI COSIMO/The Death of Procris.jpg": "The progression towards lighter colours in the background and the accompanying softening of focus reflect Leonardo da Vinci's new theories of colour. The first panel shows the death of Procris, killed by mistake, while out hunting, by a javelin which Procris had been given by King Minos and which never missed its mark. The dog on the right was also a gift from Minos.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/The Penitent St Jerome.jpg": "In this composition St Jerome, leaning on his crutch, kneels in the foreground. Behind him is a cave in the hillside that occupies more than half of the painting. He beats his chest with a stone, in front of a thin Crucifix. Hidden in the forest behind the saint, his attribute, the lion, is barely visible. In the distance, there is only a small and apparently deserted town.",
    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/Christ between Sts Peter and Paul (1).jpg": "The fresco on the ceiling of a funeral chamber depicts Christ enthroned between Sts Peter and Paul who acclaim him. In the lower register the martyr saints venerated in this catacomb are seen praising Christ. Between the saints can be seen the Lamb of God on the summit of paradise.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Grotesque Self-Portrait (2).jpg": "It is hidden away among the grotesques decorating the pillars. The artist is shown not as a member of the court, but as a silent observer of both them and the viewer.",
    "images/BARTOLINI, Lorenzo/Trust in God.jpg": "The nudity of the adolescent figure was meant to represent the human soul placing its trust in the Lord, but much of the sculpture's appeal doubtless stems from its undertone of eroticism.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Scuola di San Marco.jpg": "Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the most important Dominican church in Venice, is depicted at the right, with the equestrian monument to Bartolommeo Colleoni by the Italian sculptor Andrea Verrocchio in front of it. Beside the church and in the centre of the composition is the Scuola Grande di San Marco, the wealthiest of the six major philanthropic confraternities in the city. The square before it is teeming with a variety of figures: beggars, a mother and child, traders, elegant ladies and dogs.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/The Triumph of Pan.jpg": "He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus.",
    "images/GIANNICOLA DI PAOLO/Madonna and Child in a Landscape.jpg": "Rather than show the figures full length, Giannicola ends the composition at the Madonna's knees and excludes the figures in the background. The Christ Child is heavily reliant on Perugino's design, while the face of the Virgin is painted very much in Giannicola's own idiom.",
    "images/CLOUET, François/Henri II of Valois and Caterina de' Medici, Surrounded by Members of Their Family.jpg": "The portrait miniatures include Mary Stuart, future queen of Scots, and her husband, Francis II, as well as Francis I and Queen Claude, parents of Henri II.",
    "images/PALMA GIOVANE/Return of the Prodigal Son.jpg": "The real hero of the scene is the prodigal father, who unhesitatingly and uncomplainingly offers his compassion, hospitality, and forgiveness. These are followed by ring, sandals, robe, and fatted calf.",
    "images/MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban/The Little Fruit Seller.jpg": "A little girl with the face of a Madonna, a contented little boy examining the earnings she holds in her hand and a basket full of grapes which is, in itself, a still-life of the highest quality.",
    "images/ZAHRTMANN, Kristian/The Death of Queen Sophie Amalie.jpg": "Surrounded by silverware and magnificent silks, the dowager queen Sophie Amalie breathes her last. A grotesque figure whose status and wealth cannot deliver her from a violent and painful death by asphyxiation.",

    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/Portrait of a Lady.jpg": "It is thought that the sitter of this portrait, depicted bust-length, with pearl earrings, is an as yet unidentified member of Sir Joshua Reynolds's family. The painting is unfinished, the roughly finished head stands in sharp contrast to the unfinished drapery and incomplete background.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DI FRANCESCO DEL CERVELLIERA/Nativity and Adoration of the Magi.jpg": "The placement of the walls at an angle and the use of this background two divide the two scenes; the alternation of figures in frontal and profile view; and the contrast  of fully lit and penumbral areas attest to a strict spatial logic deployed to create a unified stage setting. The imposing wall is rendered with an obsession for architectural detail and measured by the grid formed by the scaffolding holes. Breaches in the wall enliven the scene by providing views onto the landscape, while elsewhere the wall remains intact and serves as backdrop for the figures.",
    "images/GADDI, Agnolo/Retrieval and Trial of the Three Crosses (detail).jpg": "Extending behind the scenes is a landscape of a markedly bucolic character, a world that appears to be completely untouched by the events occurring in the foreground. To the already familiar motifs - mountains, a river, trees, a citadel, and so on - are added a farm as well as people and animals.

    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/La Disputa (detail) (4).jpg": "The wreath of theologians frames the scene on earth on the left and right. The viewer's gaze moves over the perspectively receding pattern of the floor, up the steps, and toward the altar and Host. In the group of theologians on the left, several who face away from the altar are directed back to the centre. The church fathers are enthroned on either side of the altar four variations on spiritual activity: reflection, reading, perceptive seeing and edifying dictation. On the right side the row of theologians comes to an end in a tranquil, staggered arrangement of upright figures. Finally, at far right, the new arrivals are led to the altar again.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ezekiel (detail) (1).jpg": "The profile of the head is depicted in detail, accentuating its expressiveness, while that of the youth he appears to be addressing is rendered with soft glazes of colour.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Appearance on the Mountain in Galilee (panel 6).jpg": "The Appearance on the Mountain in Galilee is simpler and barer and descriptive details are deliberately left out: Christ is entrusting the apostles with the task of spreading the faith (the books that two of the disciples are holding are a reminder of preaching) and nothing must distract attention from his words.",
    "images/PACHER, Friedrich/Christ in Limbo (detail).jpg": "It is ludicrous to see him lean out from his castle at the risk of losing his balance; the fires of hell illuminate his backside with a reddish glow, while he gnashes his teeth mixed with fangs, brandishes his two-pronged fork, and makes a threatening gesture with the blunt, fleshy fingers of his other hand. His head is like that of a he-goat, on his arms there are prickles reminiscent of a bat's wings; the contours of a beak-like nose on his belly complete the phantom figure of horror created by the fantasy of the Middle Ages.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Empedocles.jpg": "The picture shows the wainscoting to the right of the entry. In the tondo a young man wearing turban, identified as Empedocles, a Greek philosopher (c. 490-430 BC), leans out of the window to watch the Apocalypse.",

    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Honor et Virtus post mortem floret.jpg": "The youthful hero of the allegory is an elegantly clad Venetian in white silk garments, who was taken at the end of the 17th century, when the picture was in the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden in Rome, to be a self-portrait of the artist. Unhesitatingly he turns to Virtue, who is crowned with a laurel wreath. Drops of blood on his ripped leg covering testify to the fruitless attempt by Vice — Lust and Pleasure, in the long run the death-bringing opponent of Virtue - to hold back the man of honour and win him over.",

    "images/BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder/Wooded River Landscape (detail).jpg": "On the right half of the painting, balancing out the seemingly mirrored tranquility of the river and sky, is a bustling shoreline and landing site filled with colourful figures, animals, and remarkably drawn boats. Beyond and through the trees at right appears a quiet village with houses, wooden sheds, horse drawn carts, and, in the distance, the steeple of a church.",
    "images/STRIGEL, Hans II/Sts Florian, John the Baptist and Sebastian.jpg": "Though these appear against a golden background decorated with a vigorously winding floral pattern, they stand on firm, realistic ground, bringing the group into a distant relationship with the Italian 'sacra conversazione'. The basic colours of the three figures' garments - black, crimson and green - melt into a tonal unity rarely encountered in German panels. The attribute of Florian, a house in flames, is much larger than the usual toy-like size of similar earlier representations, having started on the course from a symbol to a real object with a life of its own. It was evidently to counterbalance this increased volume that the artist decided to paint this saint's legs in tights which make the silhouette look slimmer, while the other two are covered by wide cloaks reaching to the ground.",
    "images/BELLOTTO, Bernardo/View of Dresden from the Right Bank of the Elbe with the Augustus Bridge.jpg": "The panorama of the city, shown in this picture, was to become the classic view of Dresden, seen approximately from the level of the Japanische Palais: the right-hand side of the painting is dominated by the Catholic Hofkirche, shining in its light shades and intensified by its reflection in the river. Behind the Hofkirche we see parts of the royal residence, including the lofty Hausmannsturm, which seems to rest on the roof of the Hofkirche. Rising up directly behind them is the majestic dome of the Protestant Frauenkirche, designed by George Bahr, newly built but already an integral part of Dresden's skyline. The way the river forms a diagonal, or the bank in the foreground a wedge shape, or the building on the far left acts as a link between picture and frame: all accord with specific rules and conventions that developed from landscape painting. Bellotto adds a number of incidental figures, most strikingly an impoverished family at the front left who have settled outside a simple wooden hut.",

    "images/POTTER, Paulus/Cattle and Sheep in a Stormy Landscape.jpg": "The dramatic formation of white and dark gray clouds contrasts with a few patches of blue, and it is uncertain whether a storm is building or the sky is about to clear up. Seen from below and positioned against the brightest portion of the sky, the young bull and the black cow in the foreground become monumental, commanding presences. In the background the lighting is reversed, Here, the peacefully resting and grazing animals, bathed in sunlight, are surrounded by windswept trees and silhouetted against the menacing dark clouds.",

He is plunging a branch into the bitter waters of Marah to sweeten them, so that the Israelites could slake their thirst. Mothers are giving their children to drink, an old man holds out a bowl to his grandson, and another man is sipping the precious liquid from his cupped hand.",
    "images/DOSSI, Dosso/The Embrace.jpg": "The subject and the meaning of the picture is unclear, but depicting the tight and apparently forcible embrace by a bestial man (a satyr?), dressed in an animal skin, of a struggling naked woman (a nymph?), the picture seems to allude to the sin of lechery.",
    "images/DOMENICHINO/General view toward the interior walls.jpg": "The picture shows the general view toward the interior walls of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori in the Abbey of Santa Maria, Grottaferrata. The elegant row of columns between the chapel and the chancel creates a caesura in terms of subject matter. Between the columns one can see into the chancel, the centre of which is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels. The long walls are divided into two stories, each divided by a door into two rectangular spaces of different width. The events from the lives of the two founders are presented in a total of seven scenes. Three scenes are in the chancel, and four on the long walls of the main room. In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.",

    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Announcement of Death to the Virgin (panel 1).jpg": "The beamed ceiling, the linearity of the horizontal pattern on the back wall, the slender arches opening onto the room where Mary is sitting, lend calm elegance to the surroundings. In the Announcement of Death the angel, his robe light and fluttering, offers the palm branch to the Virgin - the palma mortis is present in all the episodes as an emblem of death and a symbol of paradise to come. The archangel comes in through an arch on the left, and Mary receives the news while sitting at a reading-desk. he holds out a palm branch, spangled with stars, towards her.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/The Paradise.jpg": "In the centre foreground God prohibits Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge.

    "images/BRIL, Paul/The Port.jpg": "This focal point is also the source of an intense light which, reflecting on the tranquil water, confers a particular serenity to the work. It is the end of the day: in the foreground, sailors and boats are silhouetted against this sunset that is so typical of the Mediterranean. However, this is an imaginary bay, in an idyllic evocation of the open sea. It has also been observed that the masts are too high and the bowspit too long.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/The Meeting.jpg": "The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope.",

    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Introduction of the Cult of Cybele to Rome.jpg": "These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. From the left of the painting the priests in their flowing robes are approaching with a bust of Cybele. A young follower falls on his knees in reverence, his position in the centre of the picture emphasizing the unusually wide format of this work.

The Archangel Gabriel stands before her with his arms crossed and holding an olive branch in one hand, symbolizing peace. In the middle of the painting, between the figures of Mary and the archangel, is a finely worked vase holding a bunch of lilies. Above the vase, God's blessing hand sends out rays of light that carry the dove of the Holy Spirit toward Mary.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Beethoven Frieze (view of the room).jpg": "The centre wall (The Hostile Powers, the Titan Typhoeus, the Three Gorgons) was conceived as a pictorial paraphrase of the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and depicted the struggle for happiness undertaken by a knight in armour who, vanquishing the 'hostile powers' (the giant Typhon, the three Gorgons, disease, insanity and death), leads 'weak humanity' into the realm of the arts. The left longitudinal wall shows female figures gliding along horizontally. An upright nude woman and a similarly nude kneeling couple are the first figures that the floating figures meet. The \"Suffering of Weak Mankind\" group turns pleadingly towards a knight, the \"Wohlgerüsteten Starken\" (Knight in Shining Armor), who stands before them. Behind the golden knight appear two allegorical female characters, who are referred to in the catalogue as \"Ehrgeiz\" (Ambition)\" and \"Mitleid\" (Compassion). On the right longitudinal wall, the \"Sehnsüchte und Wünsche der Menschheit\" (Longings and Desires of Mankind) return as a horizontal floating procession and move on until they are stopped by the lonely figure of \"Poetry\". On the final section of this wall, a vertical group of crouching women, called \"Die Künste\" (The Arts), reach from floor to ceiling like a living pillar. It leads to the \"Chor der Paradiesesengel\" (Choir of Angels from Paradise), which corresponds to Beethoven's closing chorus of Schiller's \"Ode an die Freude\" (Ode to Joy). His pictorial representation of the \"kiss to all the world\" manifests itself in the form of an embracing naked couple, which also signals the climax and finale of the frieze.",

    "images/GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de/Portrait of the Countess of Chinchón.jpg": "The stunning dress, of a still Tiepolesque lightness, stands out against a timeless, unidentified background; but what really strikes us in this portrait is the totally unidealized face, and the closed, melancholy, uncomprehending expression which verges on idiocy. This is María Teresa de Vallabriga y Borbon, Countess of Chinchón, the daughter of Don Luis de Borbon and María Teresa de Vallabriga, and wife of Manuel Godoy, the favourite of Queen María Luisa.",

Huguet portrays the two martyrs dressed in the style of nobles of his day. The crowns which they wear on top of their fashionable hats indicate their royal rank. In their hands they carry the instruments of their martyrdom. Tall, slender, almost boringly well-proportioned figures, with gentle faces and even features, were one of the painter's hallmarks.",

    "images/STRÓBL, Alajos/Fountain of King Matthias.jpg": "The group depicts a hunting party led by Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. The bronze figures are standing on heaps of rocks against the backdrop of the northern façade of the former Castle Church. Water is running down between the cracks of the boulders. The monumental facade behind the fountain is flanked by two pairs of giant Corinthian columns. The central niche forms a triumphal arch which is decorated with King Matthias' personal coat of arms. King Matthias is standing on the highest rock in hunting attire. He is holding a crossbow in his right and a huge stag lies dead at his feet. On the lower rocks a henchman blows his horn and the leader of the hunting group rests sitting on a boulder with his back towards the viewer. Three hounds complete the central group. They are connected to the central group with gestures and gazes but they have their own plinths. On the right is Szép Ilonka (Helen the Fair), heroine of a famous 19th century ballad by Mihály Vörösmarty. The girl is looking towards the king protecting her tame fawn from the hunters. On the right is the Italian chronicler, Galeotto Marzio who lived in King Matthias court. A dog lies at his feet and a falcon sits on his arm.",

    "images/ROSSO FIORENTINO/Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "He represented the Virgin ascending dramatically upwards into the golden firmament on lavender-coloured clouds with a chorus of angels at her feet. This daringly foreshortened, angled ring of naked children is surprisingly accomplished. Certain angels are seen in the same pose but shifted round, suggesting that Rosso painstakingly studied them first from purpose-made sculptural models in the studio.",

    "images/PARMIGIANINO/Pallas Athene.jpg": "The warm flesh tones and the drapery that resembles thin sheets of beaten metal are also hallmarks of the artiste late style, although the elegant turn of the head, the etiolated fingers and the delicate treatment of the highlighted strands of hair evoke the earlier, more poetic style. The figure wears armour but lacks the helmet and spear, perhaps because the artist chose to emphasise the association with wisdom and the arts as opposed to more warlike aspects. The depiction of the city and the winged figure of Victory flying with a palm and an olive branch are references to Pallas Athene's success over Poseidon concerning the ownership of Attica, of which Athens was the capital.",

    "images/TINTORETTO/The Miracle of St Mark Freeing the Slave.jpg": "The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearence of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of the saint against his master's will. The scenes takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light, while the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/The Four Corners of the World Asia.jpg": "On the ceiling of the nave St Ignatius is depicted in a state of ecstasy, and functions as a mediator between heaven and earth. Issuing from his heart are four rays of flame radiating outwards toward elaborate animated groupings representing the four corners of the globe. These personifications sit enthroned above monstrous giants.",
    "images/MENGS, Anton Raphael/Ecce Homo.jpg": "In this work Mengs depicts Jesus shortly after having been proclaimed the King of the Jews, wearing the crown of thorns and carrying a rod as a sceptre. The blood that is beginning to dry on his right shoulder reveals the marks of the whiplashes, although the artist has preferred to focus on the psychological condition of Christ rather than on the dramatic quality of the scene. Tired and humiliated, the figure shows signs of deep suffering.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/View of the Chapel of Eleonora da Toledo.jpg": "This view shows the altarpiece and the frescoes in the Chapel of Eleonora da Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. The wall frescoes all depict scenes from the life of Moses: the left-wall frescoes include the Miracle of the Spring (Moses Striking the Rock) and the Gathering of Manna, the right wall is covered by the fresco Crossing of the Red Sea, an uncommon subject in Christian chapels. The frescoes of the vault represents Sts Michael, John the Evangelist, Jerome and Francis.",

Incomparable fifteenth century Venice then, with its buildings decorated with highly coloured frescoes and painted plaster work, with its round chimney-pots and equally characteristic jutting grills, provides a colourful and poetically archaic setting for the event. And the many characters who people the picture seem to be participants in a scene of enchantment, inhabiting a magically still atmosphere, figures set in relief against the deep green of the waters of the canal frozen forever in this moment of time.",
    "images/MASTER of Moulins/Mary Magdalen and a Donator.jpg": "The unknown donor and the Magdalen, wearing the magnificent clothes of the period, are placed in a room with a checkered stone floor. The somewhat fleshy, not too attractive, face of the donor, her hair shaved high above her forehead, rises above a brown-red robe, with a rich brooch at the neck and an impressive gold chain decorating her bosom. A cameo is suspended from the string of pearls on her belt. St Mary Magdalen, the patron saint, holds her vase of ointment in her left hand and points with the right to the lady, kneeling in an attitude of prayer. The yellow silk cap of the saint is adorned with ropes of pearls, the sleeves of her bodice are blue, the bodice itself of red-blue brocade, and the mantle green. The Magdalen's features are finely drawn, with delicate nose and lips; both of the women's faces are painted in a portrait technique, the donor's being more strongly characterized.",

    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/The Last Judgment (detail) (21).jpg": "At the far left-hand side of the polyptych, paradise is represented as a gothic porch ablaze with light, the door that leads to the divine dwelling place. Instead, it is merely represented by a pile of dark rocks spewing flames and volcanic vapours.",

Already one group of souls looks expectantly upwards.",
    "images/FERRARI, Luca/The Founding of Padua.jpg": "He points out to those present a building site crowded with workers who are scrambling about the scaffolding constructing walls.

    "images/SIMONE MARTINI/St Martin is Knighted (detail) (1).jpg": "Nothing could be more secular than the figure of the Roman Emperor fastening the sword, the symbol of his newly acquired dignity, around the knight's waist. The Emperor's immobile profile, with his half-open mouth and fixed gaze, is reminiscent of the portraits carved on ancient Roman coins, which Simone probably used as a model: even though it must be Julian the Apostate (and historically it could not be any other emperor), it has been suggested that the features are actually those of Constantine the Great.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Baptism of Christ (1).jpg": "On the third level there are two frescoes, side by side, that deal with the mission of Saint John the Baptist. In the picture on the right he is preaching, and in the next picture he is baptizing Christ. The same landscape is continued through both scenes, linking them to one another. The sixth scene of the cycle depicts the  Baptism of Christ. There is a very old-fashioned feeling about the depiction of God the Father, who is giving His blessing surrounded by angels.",
    "images/GUARDI, Francesco/Bridge at Dolo.jpg": "The motif of the slender, graceful bridge spanning a narrow lagoon was repeated by Francesco Guardi in several of his works.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/View of the Sala del Gigli.jpg": "To the right is the Porta della Catena in the south wall. In the frieze beneath the coffered ceiling are pairs of lions holding medallions containing Florentine coats of arms. The other three walls are ornamented with painted pilasters like the ones seen here and the same pattern of gold lilies on blue ground.",
    "images/MASSYS, Jan/Lot and His Daughters.jpg": "At the centre of the composition, the elder sister, half naked, is seated on the knees of the old man Lot. Alongside them, the younger sister gracefully proffers a cup of wine. To the left, Sodom is in flames, whilst the angels are helping Lot and his family to escape; to the right, Gomorrah also is in flames, and facing us, a little city has escaped the disaster. The subject matter also furnished an example of unequally aged couples, a fashionable theme at the time. In the picture, the incestuous act is symbolised by the lizard, an impure animal, in the lower left-hand corner. Similarly, the fruit that the younger sister is carrying in her laps evokes desire. The slim, well-figured shapes of the young women, their milky-coloured skins and their languid gestures give off, however, a latent eroticism which is not unambiguous.",
    "images/CALVAERT, Denys/Virgin and Child with Saints.jpg": "It is from the artist's most successful period and includes all his most admired features: vibrant colours, movement and pathos in the figures, sharp foreshortening, and the landscape upper right, which extends all the way to the horizon.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Saint Flavia.jpg": "The central panel illustrated the Ascension with the twelve Apostles, the Virgin and angels.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Woman before the Rising Sun (Woman before the Setting Sun).jpg": "The woman seen in rear view appears as a large silhouette against the intense reddish-yellow of the sky. It is difficult to interpret the fervent gesture of her outstretched arms and the stylised rays radiating from the mountains on the hazy horizon, heralding the presence of the invisible sun. Since she is stepping towards the light like an early Christian in prayer, some have sought to interpret the painting in terms of a communion with nature.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Portrait of Philip the Good (1).jpg": "The duke, who was just over 50 at the time, wears the chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece, its links representing the flints and steels used to make fire.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Coronation of the Virgin (detail) (1).jpg": "The Virgin is a key focal point in the pictorial imagery. Of all the figures, she is the most illuminated, lit by a strong raking light from the left. She is clearly visible, isolated in the open space of the upper dais. Her rose and light blue garments stand out beside the darker red lake and ultramarine of the robes of God the Father. Her profile is barely visible.",
    "images/GUERCINO/Return of the Prodigal Son.jpg": "On the left in the painting, the young man has stood up and is removing the rags of the swineherd, while an old man, presumably his father, places a hand on his shoulder and takes a clean shirt from the other, foppishly dressed young man who is holding new clothes over his outstretched arm and new shoes in his hand. By using light and shade to divide the group, Guercino lends a singular autonomy to the dynamics of the outstretched and grasping hands, thereby intensifying the narrative in a most unusual way.",
    "images/TENIERS, David the Younger/Dulle Griet (Mad Meg).jpg": "Dulle Griet, the personification of the sin of avarice in Netherlandish folklore, is here represented as a woman brandishing a sword and carrying a basket of loot.

Torture of the Jew.jpg": "At the end wall of the chapel, around the stain-glass window and below the prophets were placed the Burial of the Wood (on the left) and the Torture of the Jew (on the right). We find this scene in the middle register of the choir wall. Judas has only halfway emerged from the well. One man holds him by the hair while two others pull him out with the help of a winch set up behind the well, from which a rope has been tied around his body.",

    "images/GRECO, El/The Annunciation (detail) (2).jpg": "The picture shows the lower scene of the painting. The Archangel Gabriel, his hands crossed over his breast, is shown adoring the Virgin, who looks up expectantly from her lectern. The flaming rose bush signifies that Mary remained a virgin even after conception and refers to God's appearance to Moses in the form of a burning bush that was not consumed by the flames that engulfed it.",

    "images/LUTI, Benedetto/Boy with a Flute.jpg": "It shows a young boy   holding in his hand a flute though he appears to have been distracted by something unknown to the viewer.

    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Adam and Eve (2).jpg": "The landscape depiction gives much space to the flora and fauna, it features a lamb, a hind and a stag, two partridges, a stork, a roe deer and a stag, a heron, and behind them a lion, a wild boar, and a horse. In front of the tree is a vine with flourishing foliage.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/Crossing of the Red Sea.jpg": "This painting juxtaposes Israelites who are raising their arms to heaven, in a desperate plea for aid in the face of the approaching Egyptians, with others who are already energetically rescuing the weapons of the drowned Egyptians from the waves.",

    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Angelica and Medoro with the Shepherds.jpg": "Angelica was loved by several knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland). The fresco portrays a scene from the love story of the young knight and the maiden Angelica from Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\". The two are given temporary shelter by a shepherd couple, once Angelica has found and cared for the wounded Medoro. As a way of thanking them for their hospitality, Medoro gives them the ring which Angelica had previously received from Orlando. The simple depiction of the peasants brings to mind Giandomenico's country scenes in the foresteria.",

The narration of the event shows the boy bearing the good news, Cicogna's restrained surprise, and the more enthusiastic congratulations of the hospitaler, Priamo Balbi. In the third scene, before the dignitaries of the Church and a group of Venetian nobles, the ubiquitous Priamo Balbi ushers two elderly women from the hospital into the presence of the new doge, who has already assumed the solemn demeanour that befits his station. In the background there is an extraordinary gallery of portraits,",

    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/St Lucy Altarpiece.jpg": "The picture shows the central panel of the St Lucy Altarpiece. The predella was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. Unusual for the period, the main panel of the altarpiece shows not a timeless group of saints, nor even a scene from the life of Christ or the Virgin Mary, but an episode in the life of St Lucy belonging to the same narrative sequence as the scenes in the predella. The two women kneel near an altar during the celebration of mass, during which the priest reads the passage from the gospel describing the miraculous cure by Jesus of the woman suffering from the same affliction as Euthicia. Euthicia prays at the shrine for a similar cure while Lucy, asleep, experiences a vision of St Agatha surrounded by angels. When she awakens, Lucy cures her mother, and begs to be released from her promise to marry, so that she can give away her dowry to the poor. The scene in the first predella panel is set in a Renaissance church, the architectural spaces of which provide distinct areas for the successive events. St Lucy is represented four times, she is identifiable by her yellow robe, red cloak, and laurel crown. The second scene is restricted to a narrow field on the left of the central predella panel, bounded by the green curtain. Lucy's fiancé, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel. At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fiancé assists the panders in their fruitless efforts. The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Beethoven Frieze right wall (part 2).jpg": "A vertical group of crouching women, called \"Die Künste\" (The Arts), reach from floor to ceiling like a living pillar, leading to the \"Chor der Paradiesesengel\" (Choir of Angels from Paradise). With raised hands and closed eyes, the floating female figures sing the song of joy. His pictorial representation of the \"kiss to all the world\" manifests itself in the form of an embracing naked couple, which also signals the climax and finale of the frieze.",

The human figures, plants, trees, and other elements of nature are rendered with complete realism, while the placing of the figures and the design of the landscape are clearly defined and ordered according to rules of perspective and the use of geometric shapes for composition. Note that the three figures, and that the lines of the rocky landscape and the heads of the saints form the sides of a \"V\" which converges at the base of the Cross and emphasizes the figure of Christ silhouetted against the sky.",

As if given a place among the circle of angels, the donor Cardinal Stefaneschi kneels before the throne on the marble floor, which is laid out in perspective. He is clothed in a simple robe and has reverently laid aside his cardinal's hat. Unlike the angels, the cardinal bends forward as if he wanted to kiss the feet of the Lord.",
    "images/LEONARDO da Vinci/Leda (detail).jpg": "The composition of the upper part of the group is determined by a play of curves and contrasting turns, and the contrapposto motif of the standing Leda develops from this: the swan has turned his head up towards Leda, full of desire; her body is turned towards him and she is embracing him with her arm, but her head is to one side, looking at her children.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/View of the Chapel St Fina.jpg": "The picture shows a view of the Chapel of St Fina from the central aisle of the Collegiata. In the niche at the back, the tomb altar of St Fina by Benedetto da Maiano can be seen. In the lunette above are the Church fathers Gregory the Great and Jerome, in the vaulting the four evangelists, on the façade, the lion coat of arms of the city of San Gimignano.",
    "images/GOES, Hugo van der/Sts Anthony and Thomas with Tommaso Portinari.jpg": "The picture shows the left wing of the Portinari Triptych. Three members of the Portinari family, Tommaso Portinari and his two sons Antonio and Pigello, are portrayed kneeling, their faces pale, sculptural and almost ghostlike. Above them stand Saint Anthony Abbot and Saint Thomas, two of the family's patron saints, looking grave and solemn, their majesty almost compressed by the absence of a surrounding space. In the background, against a barren, rocky landscape, Mary and Joseph can be seen making their way to Bethlehem, an episode that prepares us for the holy event of the central panel.",
    "images/COLLIER, Edwart/Self-Portrait with a Vanitas Still- Life.jpg": "The still-life arrangement, with a violin preventing a musical score from falling off the table while resting on a closed book and holding open the pages of another, in this case an early 17th century description of the city of Leiden, with a Roemer to the left and a globe behind, is one often repeated by Collier.",
    "images/HONTHORST, Gerrit van/Merry Company.jpg": "It depicts a provocative scene of a wanton student (the prodigal son?) in the company of two prostitutes and a procuress carrying an infant. The pages of an immense open folio on the table are brilliantly illuminated by candle-light as is the semi-nude torso of the theorbo-playing prostitute. One of the pages illustrates an older man and a nude child, most likely Cupid, beating a woman who holds a large book. The opposite page shows a Latin poem.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Officer with a Laughing Girl.jpg": "The young woman is bathed in light, which streams in through the half open window to the left, and reflects itself from the cream-coloured background that is enhanced to the left by very thin glazes of slightly pinkish tonalities. Her face, exceptionally conveying expression  - joy and laughter - appears framed in a kerchief and the collar of her dress. That part of the figure, especially, reveals itself as a symphony of luminosity, set off by the dark sleeves of the yellow jacket on which glittering highlights dance. In contrast, the soldier in the black hat and red jacket is placed close to the viewer, from whom he turns his back. The nearest foreground - the soldier on his chair and the dark-green part of the table cover - are so strongly enhanced that the use of an optical instrument by Vermeer for the structuring of the composition seems indisputable. We have here the typical effect of the inverted telescope: the foreground standing out in the manner of stage scenery, while the figure of the girl recedes into space. On the back of the wall, we find for the first time a map.",
    "images/FOPPA, Vincenzo/Altarpiece.jpg": "The Madonna's face, lightly thrown into relief, concludes a series of circling motifs enhanced by the elegant twist of the body of the Child, as he leans over to pluck the string of the lute. In the panel above, St Francis appears as a motionless, somewhat astonished figure immersed in the limpid air of a lyric landscape.",
    "images/DEVÉRIA, Eugène-François-Marie-Joseph/Portrait of Laurence Davidson and His Three Sons.jpg": "This painting represents Laurence Davidson and his three sons, three-quarter length, standing by ruins, his sons seated around him, one holding a fishing rod, the other holding a cricket bat.",
    "images/WEBB, James/A Barge in a Norfolk Landscape.jpg": "The painting shows a barge lying moored alongside a reedy bank on the Norfolk Broads.",
    "images/TILBORGH, Gillis van/Family Portrait (detail).jpg": "The walls are covered with figured wallpaper, servants are eagerly waiting for the master and the mistress' commands and there is animated activity in the kitchen.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Zechariah (detail) (2).jpg": "Above the door forming the main entrance to the Sistine Chapel - in its turn surmounted by the inscription with the name of the prophet Zechariah - the coat of arms of the della Rovere, with a papal tiara and oak tree bearing twelve gold acorns, commemorates the chapel's founder, Sixtus IV.",
    "images/CRESPI, Giuseppe Maria/The Flea.jpg": "Through the oiled paper in the window frame, a milky light falls into the humble servant's room. Clothing is scattered untidily on the floor and thrown over a roughly made bench. A few household objects and some washing on a bar hang against the bare brick wall, whose only remaining decoration consists of a few personal items. The pretty woman who lives in this room, a maid or servant girl, is sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed only in a shift. As she concentrates on her search for a flea that has probably hidden on her breast, she reveals her round knees, her plump arms and her well formed shoulder. AIthough there are a number of allegorical reflections - the little dog at the end of the bed, the roses in the vase next to the cosmetic jar they nevertheless do not seriously mean to identify this girl with Venus.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Pilate's First Interrogation of Christ (scene 13).jpg": "The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maestà. It is situated in the bottom row on the right side below the scene of Christ Accused by the Pharisees. The slender spiral columns of white marble and the decoration carved along the top of the walls seem to refer to classical architecture. Pilate too, portrayed with the solemnity of a Roman emperor and crowned with a laurel wreath, evokes the world of classical antiquity. As in the gospel, the group of Pharisees, animated by lively gestures (again the hand with pointing finger), is depicted outside the building: the Jews avoid going inside in order not to be defiled and to be able to eat the Passover meal.",
    "images/BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans/Pyramus and Thisbe.jpg": "The lovers, forbidden by their parents to marry, planned to meet in secret one night beside a spring. Blaming himself for his lover's supposed death he plunged his sword into his side.",
    "images/UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Russian/The Last Judgment.jpg": "This elaborate, multifigure composition has, at the top, Christ in judgment surrounded by the apostles. Below, on the left, is an allegorical depiction of Paradise; on the right are the Earth and Sea.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Landscape with the Voyage of Jacob.jpg": "This landscape, with its winding river, elegant trees, and grand castle, is an idealized vision of the countryside near Rome, where Claude spent most of his career. The tiny camels on the right hint at the biblical story, but the painting is essentially a celebration of nature at its most poetic.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DA MILANO/Christ and the Virgin Enthroned with Six Saints (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the Virgin's head.",
    "images/BOUCHER, François/The Rising of the Sun.jpg": "These extravagant and wonderful pictures show Apollo as God of the Sun leaving Tethys with her Nereids and Tritons in the river Ocean as he drives up the morning sun in his chariot drawn by four white horses, and then returning to her at nightfall.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish/Caesar Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl.jpg": "She pointed to the Ara Coeli, a heavenly altar seen in the sky as a sign.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Ballerina with a Bouquet, Curtsying.jpg": "The dancers are painted more and more in close-up. The dancer is a sylph, arms outstretched, and still carried by the last movement at the close of her solo. She bows, bathed in the brilliant spotlight, with the unreal, fantastic decor of the ballet as her background.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Madonna with Canon van der Paele.jpg": "Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon.",
    "images/TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de/Monsieur Maxime Dethomas at the Opera Ball.jpg": "Dethomas was tall and chubby but, in spite of his stature, tended to be insecure.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece (wings closed).jpg": "The realism of the figures of Adam and Eve at the far right and left on the open altarpiece struck contemporary viewers forcefully, and this style continues on the outside of the panels when the altarpiece is closed. The external decoration shows the Erithraean and Cumaean Sibyls, Prophets Zacharias and Micheas, the figures of Jodocus Vyd, the donor, and his wife Isabelle Borluut kneeling on either side of two grisaille (painted in gray to resemble statuary) representations of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, and the Annunciation with the angel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary. The angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation are separated by two small panels, one with the representation of an arched window looking out upon a city square, and the other with a wash basin and ewer set into a niche and a white towel hanging from a rail beside it. Three orders of reality are present: a narrative representation of a sacred subject (the Annunciation), two highly factual donor portraits and two simulated sculptures.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse.jpg": "The focal point is formed by a wall fresco which creates the illusion of a lavishly framed altar painting with a predella. In order to support the illusion, Gozzoli painted a small pointed picture on the lower frame showing the face of Christ, just as if it had been added at a later stage in the manner of a votive picture. On the cross vault are depicted the four Evangelists and Christ Giving his Blessing, on the keystone. The Dormitio Virginis is on the left wall and the Assumption, with the delivery of the Virgin's girdle to St Thomas, on the right wall.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Bronze nudes (1).jpg": "Two bronze-coloured male nudes also recline on the cornice of the pendentive representing David and Goliath, while the pairs of putti are placed, respectively, at the sides of the thrones of the prophet Zechariah and Joel.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon.jpg": "In the Man and Woman Looking at the Moon Friedrich has portrayed himself and his wife gazing at the moon in Romantic wonderment.",

    "images/KAUW, Albrecht/Still-Life.jpg": "This painting depicts a still-life of dead game birds, gherkins, a melon and walnuts all on a wooden table.",
    "images/CORREGGIO/Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day).jpg": "A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Landscape with Apollo and the Cumaean Sibyl.jpg": "Claude sets this melancholic subject among overgrown ancient ruins.",

    "images/ROORE, Jacques Ignace de/The Idolatry of Jeroboam.jpg": "While sacrificing to idols on the square in front of the temple, the altar breaks into pieces. The king, the priests and the people watch in horror. On the left, sacrificial animals are prepared for slaughter, on the right side there are precious censers and other dishes.",
    "images/FROMENT, Nicolas/The Burning Bush (detail).jpg": "The picture is mainly Gothic in concept and in its copious use of symbol as well as the choice of vision as the principal theme. A closer look at the background behind the Burning Bush reveals a typically Tuscan landscape.",
    "images/MASTER of Frankfurt/Triptych.jpg": "The triptych depicts the Holy Family with Musical Angel in the centre, flanking by St Catherine of Alexandria (left) and St Barbara (right).",
    "images/ENGEBRECHTSZ., Cornelis/Virgin and Child with St Anne.jpg": "This circular panel shows a theme especially popular in the North at the time. The ringed format echoes the theme of Christ as Saviour of the world, who is seen here blessing the apple held in St Anne's hand, yet another rounded object.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/St Monica (on the pillar).jpg": "St Monica, the mother of St Augustine, is in contrast to customary iconography holding a book instead of a rosary.",

    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Christ Surrounded by Musician Angels.jpg": "The picture shows the central panel of a triptych which originally decorated the great organs of the church Santa Maria la real at Najera, in Castile.

    "images/VERKOLJE, Johannes I/Two Children.jpg": "The present intimate portrait, a characteristically fine work by the artist, depicts two children at an arched stone window, one holding a salver of fruit.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Madonna and Child (2).jpg": "The parapet in front of the exquisitely refined figures, together with the shallow rectangular recess behind the gilt cloth, establishes the subtle and endlessly varied terms of Lippi's continuous dialogue between sculpture and painting on the one hand and between the illusionism of Renaissance painting and the ornamental qualities of Late Gothic painting on the other.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/The Last Judgment (detail) (13).jpg": "The picture shows the upper panel to the right.",
    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/Hercules and Cacus.jpg": "It has three entrances and presents an elaborate painted decoration extending across all four walls and the entire ceiling. A simple, rhythmic arrangement of columns, backed by a gilt ground, structures all four walls in the room. On three sides it is interrupted by a large, arched centre opening. Prominent on the end wall is the depiction of the young Hercules at the Crossroads between Vice and Virtue, the other two openings contains Hercules and Cacus, and Hercules and Nessus.",
    "images/BELLOTTO, Bernardo/New Market Square in Dresden from the Jüdenhof.jpg": "Bellotto depicts the prince elector in his state coach approaching the entrance to the gallery.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Last Judgment Triptych (detail) (7).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the lower part of the central panel.",
    "images/VIGNON, Claude/David with the Head of Goliath.jpg": "The strong shaft of light coming from the upper left increases the sense of drama in a seemingly calm scene by contrasting the beauty of the protagonist with the horror of the preceding event. David is depicted as androgynous, which reflects an ideal of beauty for young men in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.",
    "images/EVERDINGEN, Caesar van/Nymphs Offering the Young Bacchus Wine, Fruit and Flowers.jpg": "The principal character in the painting is the young man with his foot on a high marble step on the right. He can be identified as the wine god Bacchus by his coronet of vine leaves and the ivy-twined staff in his hand. His left foot rests on two rather puzzling  objects: one is a mask of an elderly man with white locks and a moustache, and the other is the leather skirt of a shiny metal cuirass. The three sparsely-clad young women in attendance on the left are fitting companions for the lusty Bacchus. The nymph opposite Bacchus extends her right arm to offer him a glass of wine. Bacchus reaches out to receive it, taking the stem between his thumb and index finger.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Birth of St John the Baptist (detail) (1).jpg": "Here a beautiful unknown woman from the donor's immediate circle is looking at us. She is holding a small cloth in her hands, which are elegantly clasped in front of her stomach, and dressed in a gentle pink, a hue picked up in her cheeks. Two women wearing white head-dresses accompany her; the elder is probably the donor's sister, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, who died before the picture was painted.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Beethoven Frieze right wall (part 1).jpg": "The \"Sehnsüchte und Wünsche der Menschheit\" (Longings and Desires of Mankind) return on the connecting right wall as a horizontal floating procession and move on until they are stopped by the lonely figure of \"Poetry.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Sacrifice of Isaac (detail).jpg": "The painting illustrates the passage of the Old Testament in which God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his only son, Isaac. God's messenger says to Abraham (Genesis 22, verse 12) pointing with his left hand at a ram to sacrifice instead.",
    "images/CONTE, Jacopino del/Frescoes on the entrance wall.jpg": "Entering to the oratory we can find on the entrance wall at right the scene St John the Baptist Preaching (1538, on the left on the photo) and the Baptism of Christ (1541, on the right).",
    "images/POTTER, Paulus/Horses in a Field.jpg": "This painting depicts two horses near a gate in a meadow. They stand on a rise where the mane and tail of the dark horse apparently catch a lot of wind. The gate is an essential element of the composition: it forms the transition between the high foreground and the low-lying background.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Primavera (2).jpg": "Above all it is the women's domed stomachs that demonstrate the contemporary ideal of beauty. Venus is standing in the centre of the picture, set slightly back from the other figures. Above her, Cupid is aiming one of his arrows of love at the Three Graces, who are elegantly dancing a roundel. The garden of the goddess of love is guarded by Mercury on the left. Mercury, who is lightly clad in a red cloak covered with flames, is wearing a helmet and carrying a sword, clearly characterizing him as the guardian of the garden. The messenger of the gods is also identified by means of his winged shoes and the caduceus staff which he used to drive two snakes apart and make peace; Botticelli has depicted the snakes as winged dragons. From the right, Zephyr, the god of the winds, is forcefully pushing his way in, in pursuit of the nymph Chloris. Next to her walks Flora, the goddess of spring, who is scattering flowers. For the month of May, Flora tells how she was once the nymph Chloris, and breathes out flowers as she does so. Aroused to a fiery passion by her beauty, Zephyr, the god of the wind, follows her and forcefully takes her as his wife. Regretting his violence, he transforms her into Flora, his gift gives her a beautiful garden in which eternal spring reigns. Botticelli is depicting two separate moments in Ovid's narrative, the erotic pursuit of Chloris by Zephyr and her subsequent transformation into Flora. This is why the clothes of the two women, who also do not appear to notice each other, are being blown in different directions. Flora is standing next to Venus and scattering roses, the flowers of the goddess of love.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Scenes from the Life of St John the Evangelist 1. St John on Patmos.jpg": "Peaceful and self-absorbed, the Evangelist sits on the island of Patmos. Only the way he holds his head demonstrates that he is concentrating on his inner visions. At the bottom corners of the lunette angels bind up the wind, in order that calm can be restored. The dragon, which threatens the woman and child, and he who is like the son of man, are the principal figures of the vision of the end of the world and of the second coming of Christ.",
    "images/FONTEBASSO, Francesco/Supplemental scene (1).jpg": "Completing the decoration are some other images that are not connected to the subject of the principal sections. Faux colonnades that reveal glimpses of imposing classical buildings frame a variety of figures, The present picture shows a pair of lovers engaged in affectionate conversation.",
    "images/SNYDERS, Frans/Boar Hunt.jpg": "Here, the dog on the far right may be wearing a protective cloak because he was particularly prized by his owner.",
    "images/WTEWAEL, Joachim/The Judgment of Paris (1).jpg": "The scene depicts the story of his award of the golden apple to Venus in a contest of beauty between her, Juno, and Minerva.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Dulle Griet (detail) (2).jpg": "This painting contains a world filled with strange, diabolical figures, often made up of dissimilar parts. Here, a sitting figure with a boat on his back is spooning gold out of an egg-shaped rear.",
    "images/VELSEN, Jacob van/A Musical Party.jpg": "In the centre of the painting an elegantly dressed group of two men and a woman make music. The man on the right plays the violin and looks at the woman who is beating time. She and the man next to her are singing from a score. To the right of the group is a table laid with plates, a knife, a glass, a silver jug, and, in the centre, a decorated meat pie. Behind the table a boy waves a glass at the central group while a maid looks on. In the left corner, cast in shadow, a man stands casually leaning on a chair and smoking a pipe. The scene is set in a simple interior with a stone floor and plain, light gray walls.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/Assumption.jpg": "Filippino's music-making angels are skillfully incorporated into the curve of the wall, and their joyful celebration is appropriate to the occasion. The angels have sweeping, agitated draperies that indicate movement, but emphasis is placed on the edges of forms so that they appear flat and linear rather than three-dimensional. Mary, standing on a cloud bank, is heavily draped, and the presumed weight-free left leg emerges beneath the swells of the garment, in a shift from the normal gravitational logic.",
    "images/ROSA, Salvator/Portrait of the Artist's Wife Lucrezia.jpg": "The portrait shows the painter's wife Lucrezia, who also served as model for other Rosa paintings such as the 1642 Allegory of Poetry also in the possession of the National Gallery in Rome. Rosa depicts her with a deep degree of psychological penetration, dramatized by the highlighting of the face against the dark background.",
    "images/CUSTODIS, Hieronymos/An Elizabethan Courtier.jpg": "It depicts  a vase of gillyflowers, a sparrow 'nipping the bud' of a gillyflower (carnation), above which is an inscription 'fatto a tempo', ('done in time').",
    "images/CANALETTO/La Vigilia di Santa Marta.jpg": "From the bank between the water and the houses the view is toward the west, where the church of Santa Marta closes off the buildings. To the left of the church the silhouette of the island of San Giorgo in Alga appears on the horizon, in the left corner is a house on another small island. Fishing boats decorated with balloons sail about, while tents and windscreens for the many musicians and cooks are spread over the grounds. A gondoliers assistant and his lady dance the furlana to the accompaniment of violin, guitar and tamborine, while a distinguished- looking foreigner is cajoled into dancing by a woman of the working class. The multitude of diverse visual elements has been neatly arranged by Canaletto along two crossing diagonals, with the church at the point of intersection.",
    "images/FASOLO, Giovanni Antonio/East wall of the camerone (detail) (2).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the scene Sofonisba Asking Massinissa for Mercy.",
    "images/MOILLON, Louise/Still-Life with Basket of Plums.jpg": "The present still-life adapts the subject of a simple basket filled with damson plums arranged frontally on a table. The composition is staged against a dark background highlighting the Caravaggesque theatrical effect. The light projects from beyond the frame and from the left. It draws the shadow of the basket and accentuates the drama and realism.",
    "images/SNYDERS, Frans/The Pantry.jpg": "The scene is set in the kitchen of a vast house. A maidservant, said to be painted by Cornelis de Vos, is carrying a tray full of quails and crowned with a pheasant. Her head turned to the right, she is standing alongside a large rectangular table spilling over with victuals. The painting is organised on several levels around a white swan, whose body and outstretched wings occupy the centre of the scene. Next to it, a gutted roebuck is hanging by one paw from a hook. A lobster, a peacock and some birds are laid out on the table. A wicker basket spilling over with fruit and a copper basin with quarters of meat add to the impression of abundance. A rack at the top of the painting from which hang two salmon steaks, birds and two hares, strengthens the horizontal aspect of the composition. In the left foreground, a plate of oysters is placed on a bench, whilst, to the far right, a wicker basked is laden profusely with fruits and vegetables. A cat, preparing to steal fish from a serving dish, and a dog, avidly viewing the servant's plate, provide a lively contrast to the dead animals. It would well be that the poultry, the parrot, the dog, the cat and the roebuck embody the five senses, whilst the birds, the fish, the fruit and vegetables, the lobster and the game symbolise the four elements of air, water, earth and fire respectively. In the same order of things, the maidservant and the birds (the Dutch word \"vogelen\", literally \"to bird\", also refers to the sexual act) are perhaps an allusion to worldly temptations and to physical love.",
    "images/RENI, Guido/Adam.jpg": "The nude figure of Adam in the niche to the left of the altar alludes the original sin, which has been overcome thanks to Mary's contribution. The nude Eve that was originally pictured in the opposite niche, an indispensable figure in such a context, was painted over by the pope's request, replaced by an unidentified prophet.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Last Supper (detail).jpg": "The picture shows the left part of the fresco.",
    "images/KØBKE, Christen/View of One of the Lakes in Copenhagen.jpg": "The painting shows two figures on the edge of a jetty watching a departing boat. The whole mood of the picture - the Spartan design of the jetty and the tender melancholy of the evening sun - suggest sadness at separation.",

In the portrait on the chair behind Fischer is a violin, on which he was apparently also an accomplished performer although only in private.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Last Judgment Triptych (open) (1).jpg": "Christ is seated on a circular rainbow which separates the world above from the world below, his feet resting on a golden globe. To either side of his head are the lily of mercy and the blazing sword of justice.",
    "images/LE BRUN, Charles/Alexander and Porus.jpg": "Porus’s elephants can be seen lying dead in the background.",
    "images/COLONNA, Angelo Michele/Ceiling of the Antechamber.jpg": "The picture shows the ceiling of the Antechamber, one of the adjoining three rooms on the ground floor in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici in the Palazzo Pitti. Viewed by his four predecessors (Cosimo I, Francesco I, Ferdinando I, Cosimo II), who are in attendance as painted busts with associated narrative scenes painted in monochrome, on the ceiling Ferdinando II is receiving his authority directly from Jupiter.",
    "images/VENNE, Adriaen Pietersz. van de/Winter.jpg": "The brilliantly lit scene of ice skating, ice fishing, and ice sailing is one of fun and flirtation, since warm weather is the time when the poor work in the fields and the wealthy travel.",
    "images/LEERMANS, Pieter/Young Woman with Guitar.jpg": "In this elegant genre scene, a young woman holding a guitar with her hand tries to play the instrument. The most striking element within the composition is the woman leaning out of the window. Hearing symbolized by the guitar, touch and sight by the butterfly, smell by the perfume of the plant, and taste by the oranges on top of the rock.",
    "images/ZURBARÁN, Francisco de/The Immaculate Conception (1).jpg": "In these pictures Mary is usually represented as a child or as a young girl, her eyes turned heavenwards, personifying innocence and childlike devotion and rising amidst clouds and cherubs to heaven. The Virgin is a slender, delicate young girl with an exquisite oval face and golden hair falling to her shoulders, a vision in white and ultramarine seen against a golden sky peopled with cherubs.",
    "images/GIORDANO, Luca/The Fall of the Rebel Angels.jpg": "At the same time, the theme of the struggling angel also symbolized the triumph of light over the rebellion of the powers of darkness - giving the painter an opportunity to create a chiaroscuro charged with meaning, in which heaven and hell, the incense of the blessed and the brimstone of the damned are contrasted in an extremely confined space, creating an arc of tension within which the knight-like angel spreads his broad wings and wields his sword in a sweeping gesture of victory. Against a background of deep golden light, the archangel balances with an almost balletic movement on the heavy breast of Lucifer, entangled amidst a group of his servants, his angular and batlike wings cutting through the hazy sfumato of the hellfire. Michael is not attacking the figures from hell with his sword, but is holding it aloft like a sign, as though his mere appearance were enough to cast Satan and his followers into eternal damnation.",
    "images/NEROCCIO DE' LANDI/Madonna and Child with St John the Baptist and St Mary Magdalene.jpg": "Here, he has inserted John the Baptist, who carries a scroll that proclaims the coming of Christ, and Mary Magdalene, who holds the jar of oil with which she anointed the feet of Jesus.",
    "images/MORETTO da Brescia/Portrait of Tullia d'Aragona as Salome (detail).jpg": "Like most of Moretto's female portraits, some of the poetess's features are idealised, but the somewhat accentuated nose, the bright eyes, and the long neck reflect her actual physiognomy. The light coming from the top left highlights the pearls in her hair.",
    "images/AELST, Willem van/Still-Life of Fruit.jpg": "The picture depicts a still-life with peaches and grapes fallen from an over-turned basket, resting on a partly-draped marble ledge.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Agatha Bas.jpg": "He placed both husband and wife in illusionistic painted frames, an effect heightened by the cloak and glove seemingly hanging over the edge of the frame in Nicholas's portrait, and the fingers of Agatha's left hand which appear to project beyond the frame here.",
    "images/GRECO, El/Christ as Saviour (1).jpg": "Christ is shown here both as Saviour of the World (Salvator Mundi) and the Light of the World. Radiant with divine light, he rests his hand on a globe enveloped in the folds of his cloak.",
    "images/HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van/St Luke Painting the Virgin and Child.jpg": "The setting is barren, with a blank wall behind the evenly placed figures as if they were part of a deeply cut frieze.",
    "images/HERRING, John Frederick the Younger/A Peaceful Day in the Farmyard.jpg": "In this idyllic scene, three sturdy farm horses are presented against the blue sky and sun-dappled fields of a summer’s day. Pigs root around by a hut and chickens peck at the ground in perfect harmony with their equine friends.",
    "images/TURCHI, Alessandro/Lamentation over the Body of Christ.jpg": "A basket in the foreground contains the crown of thorns and purple robe with which he was mocked on the way to his crucifixion. Mary Magdalene tenderly examines his wounds by the light of an angel's torch. The stone's dark unpainted surface contrasts with the brightly lit figures, enhancing the drama of the scene.",
    "images/SPEECKAERT, Michel Joseph/Flower Still-Life.jpg": "This unusual Neo-classical painting shows a flowered vase on a marble ledge.",
    "images/BASSANO, Jacopo/Summer (Sacrifice of Isaac).jpg": "In this painting the theme of summer is introduced by a scene of sheep-shearing and a woman pausing for repose with three children. The three scenes in the middle ground - harvesting, gathering, and thrashing the crop - confirm that the episode takes place in summer. In the background on the left, the sketchily depicted figures are engaged in the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/The School of Tagaste (detail).jpg": "In places Benozzo added genre details to his depiction of the life of St Augustine: on the right side, in a simultaneous scene in front of a columned loggia, the teacher is punishing a small pupil by delivering birch strokes to his bare backside. The laziness of other pupils is contrasted with the quickness to learn of the little Augustine, who is walking at the teacher's side and eagerly studying a small slate with Greek letters. The other pupils who are present at the scene appear to be taking no notice of it.",
    "images/SAVOLDO, Giovanni Girolamo/Portrait of a Man in Armour (known as Gaston de Foix}.jpg": "A strange work of art, the painting reflects the remarkable ability of its creator and is also designed to suggest the general superiority of painting over sculpture: thanks to two mirrors in the background, and the various parts of the armour, the viewer has a view of the knight in the round, and also a complete view of the room and its furniture from every angle.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/Torture of St John the Evangelist.jpg": "The Torture of St John the Evangelist is in the lunette above the scene of St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Drusiana on the left wall of the chapel. The torture of John the Evangelist takes place in a splendidly decorated courtyard. One of the soldiers is poking the fire so strenuously that another, in the group on the right, about to throw more wood on it, has to protect his face with his hand, and a third screens himself with his shield. At this moment the emperor has risen from his seat and extended his arm, bringing a stop to the torture.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Mystical Marriage of St Catherine (detail).jpg": "The Virgin is seated at the top of three steps, between massive columns. Veronese's juxtaposed hues are at their best in the pair of angels seated at the lower left-hand corner who, instead of paying attention to the divine favour bestowed on St Catherine, seem to be arguing over a piece of music.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Temptation of St Anthony (detail) (12).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the right wing, depicting the Wedding of the Frogs (Fraenger). The Devil-Queen appears in the river before Anthony, shielding her private parts with a false modesty and surrounded by her infernal court.",
    "images/VERSTAPPEN, Martin/View of a Monastery in the Roman Countryside.jpg": "The effect of depth is accentuated by the use of an aerial perspective in the background, as well as the objects found on the sides: the tree, struck by lightning, on the right, and a rocky cliff on the left, serve to frame the composition and guide the spectator's eye towards the centre of the painting, occupied by a classic monastery. The end of the religious service is the opportunity to capture several groups of people in traditional dress, who help animate the landscape and add to the general harmony of the piece.",
    "images/ORCAGNA/St Matthew and Scenes from his Life (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows two scenes: St Matthew raises the son of King Egippus (above) and Martyrdom of St Matthew (below).",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Allegory of Time Governed by Prudence.jpg": "This is an exceptional portrait which depicts the aged Titian on the left above a wolf's head, his son Orazio in the centre above the head of a lion, and his nephew Marco above a dog's head. The wolf, the lion and the dog, symbolize the past, present and future.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 8 Scenes from the Life of the Virgin 2. Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple (before restoration).jpg": "The picture shows the fresco before the restoration completed in 2002.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/La Disputa (detail) (14).jpg": "The detail shows the portrait of Fra Angelico.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/7b. Recognition of the True Cross (detail) (7).jpg": "The succession of buildings  on the right-hand edge of the composition follows a road that leads to a church with a typical bell tower and a high, rounded dome ending in a lantern.",
    "images/MOLENAER, Jan Miense/Self-Portrait with Family Members.jpg": "The clock and the short-lived bubbles blown by the youngest boy, although plausible elements in a family portrait, allude to the passing of time and life as well.",
    "images/SODOMA, Il/Life of St Benedict, Scene 30 Benedict Foretells the Destruction of Montecassino.jpg": "Sodoma illustrates successive phases of a single event. In this scene the viewer is far more captivated by the massive rump of a horse looming up in the foreground or the two men scuffling on the right than by the actual subject matter, which is presented only in a tiny secondary scene in the background.",
    "images/GRECO, El/The Holy Family (1).jpg": "Noteworthy is the figure of St John the Baptist: he turns towards the viewer and makes a gesture urging silence so that the child will not be awakened.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Landscape with Dancing Figures.jpg": "They are wide in scale and the atmosphere is of broad daylight.",
    "images/TITO, Santi di/Vision of St Thomas Aquinas.jpg": "The painting depicts a miraculous event in the life of the Dominican saint when Christ spoke to him from a painted crucifix. It shows Thomas kneeling in a religious rapture before a crucified Christ, flanked by St Catherine of Alexandria and the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and St John, who seem to have moved out of the painting depicted on the walls of the niche behind them into physical space.",
    "images/PAOLO DI GIOVANNI FEI/Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple (1).jpg": "It would have been flanked, in all probability, by standing saints - one of them Peter - and surmounted by other saints shown half-length. In this depiction, she stands at the top of the long stair with a last sidelong look at her parents, yet she remains fearless and strong. Like those of the high priest who receives her, Mary's robes are splendid gold brocade. A gallery at the right is filled with the girls who will be Mary's companions. On the other side, near Mary's parents, Anna and Joachim, an onlooker cranes for a glimpse and a woman kneels, her face half hidden by a pillar.",
    "images/JUAN DE FLANDES/The Nativity.jpg": "Here, however, the child is naked and lies on his mother's robe upon the ground, implying that the son of god was poorer than the humblest son of man. The ox and ass, eating from the straw-filled manger, are not mentioned together in Luke. Meanwhile, illuminating the starry night, concentric rings of divine light emanate from the angel appearing to the shepherds on the distant hilltop. Perched on the ruined stable, an owl may refer to the nocturnal darkness dispelled by the coming of Christ.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Baroncelli Polyptych (1).jpg": "Beneath the central panel the altar is described as OPUS MAGISTRI JOCTI (Work of the Master Giotto). Many angels and saints have come together in a radiant assembly. They all want to be part of the coronation of the Mother of God by her son. In the rows at the front kneeling angels make music, in those at the back the looks and gestures of those present are oriented towards the central event.",
    "images/ROMBOUTS, Theodor/Allegory of the Five Senses.jpg": "The old man with glasses and a mirror represents Sight. The blind man is symbolic of the sense of Touch. The jolly man with a glass of wine in his hand portrays Taste, and the elegant young man with a pipe and garlic, Smell.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Youth between Virtue and Vice.jpg": "The painting treats an allegorical theme: the young man who has to choose between Vice and Virtue. Vice is embodied by a woman sitting on the left, whose scanty garments reveal part of her breasts, whereas the other, bare-footed woman, with the laurel wreath of glory on her head and taking a resolute step away to the right as if wishing to leave the picture field, personifies Virtue.",
    "images/DYCK, Sir Anthony van/Portrait of Peeter Stevens.jpg": "Anna was placed on the left, so that Stevens did not have his back turned to her.",
    "images/PRIMATICCIO, Francesco/Interior view (1).jpg": "Adjoining the Porte Dorée to the east is the vast Salle de Bal, designed by Sebastiano Serlio, and next to it in turn is the Chapelle St-Saturnin, on the site of the original medieval chapel. The photo shows the Salle de Bal (also called  Galerie Henri II) designed by Sebastiano Serlio (1541).",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto (1).jpg": "On his eagle, Jupiter swoops down towards Neptune and Pluto, who are standing at the opposite edge of the ceiling, as if he were making the sky light up with a crystal ball.",
    "images/HALS, Dirck/Merry Company.jpg": "The bed on the left in the background, and the body language of the couples leave us in little doubt as to the situation. At the same time, however, this is also a \"five senses\" scene: not only is the sense of touch satisfied, but there is also music and singing, smoking and drinking, while the eyes feast on an empty jug or a bodice.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Exhumation of St Hubert.jpg": "Bishop Walcaud of Liège, planning to move the corpse to the Benedictine abbey of Andage, is swinging a censer in the foreground left; Emperor Louis the Pious (778-840) and Archbishop Adelward of Cologne are kneeling one each side of the altar. The onlookers, who wear contemporary clothing, probably include the two donors of the pictures, with their families.",
    "images/DELACROIX, Eugène/Sketch for Peace Descends to Earth.jpg": "The ceiling was to have been occupied by a huge allegory.",
    "images/BOUCHER, François/The Birth of Venus.jpg": "It is a glimpse to make anyone less forlorn as these creatures rise dripping from the waves. The green water itself becomes an exciting erotic element as it swells and falls, bearing up the pearl-pale bodies that abandon themselves to it and offer their limbs like branches of white coral as perches for Venus's doves. Despite the snorting dolphins and having Tritons, the tumbling putti and the tremendous twist of silver and salmon-pink striped awning, the goddess remains a ravishingly pretty., demure girl, half-shy of the commotion of which she is the centre. She, like the nymphs around her, is reality idealized, divinely blonde and slender, touched with a voluptuous vacancy, a lack of animation, which perhaps only increase her charm.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/The Meeting (detail) (2).jpg": "The three picture panels of the west wall are also conceived as imaginary views through a curtained loggia. The painted curtains have been drawn so far to the side that we can see a landscape beneath a blue sky dotted with clouds that extends across the entire width of the wall. This panorama, consisting of rolling hills and occasional bizarre outcropping of rock, is enlivened by thriving, well-fortified cities and country people hard at work in the fields. Adorning the countryside are stone walls, dwellings aqueducts, and marble statues.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Entombment (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the head of Mary.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/St Jerome.jpg": "The suntan revealed in this upright picture on the old man's face and hands, in contrast to the light colour on his arms and upper body, indicates that Caravaggio was again studying from a living model. With only a piece of white drapery around his loins, and his Cardinal-red mantle slung across his legs, the old man has his left hand resting on his mantle, which also covers the table, whilst he is pensively stroking his beard with his right hand. Although his head is lowered, he is not looking at the skull in front of him. That said, the skull's empty eye-sockets appear to be staring at him.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/Vault decoration (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the spandrel with putto and Justitia.",
    "images/EECKHOUT, Gerbrand van den/Elisha and the Shunammite Woman.jpg": "In the typological comparison of Old and New Testament themes the kneeling Shunammite is a prefiguration of Mary Magdalene at the feet of Christ.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/Pietà.jpg": "Even the distant landscape - a rare feature in Bronzino's art - looks Quattrocentesque in the stylisation of trees and hills. Calvary at the left and a small wood at the right anchor the arc of the horizon, locking it to the upper corners of the frame; in the lower corners Christ, his limbs stiffened in rigor mortis, fits into the left, and the Magdalen into the right.",
    "images/RIPPL-RÓNAI, József/Portrait of James Pitcairn-Knowles.jpg": "James Pitcairn-Knowles (1863-1954), shown wearing a wide-brimmed hat, was a painter of Scots descent.",
    "images/GENTILESCHI, Orazio/Annunciation.jpg": "The huge red drape hanging behind the Madonna's pure white bed is an overt homage to Caravaggio.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun.jpg": "It is staged on the east wall of the main hall. The chariot appears in the lower section, with spirited horses, ready to lead him into the sky, their bridles held by the Hours.",
    "images/FERENCZY, Károly/Evening I.jpg": "The painting depicts three naked young men standing on the bank of a stream with their back to the viewer.",
    "images/NUZI, Allegretto/Sts Catherine and Bartholomew (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the head of St Bartholomew.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Pope Leo X with Cardinals Giulio de' Medici and Luigi de' Rossi (detail).jpg": "There is nothing idealized in the slightly puffed head of the near-sighted Pope, who has just examined an old manuscript (somewhat similar in style and period to the Queen Mary's Psalter).",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/St Mark the Evangelist.jpg": "In the Gothic vaults of the Tornabuoni Chapel the four Evangelists are floating on clouds. St Mark the Evangelist is concentrating on sharpening his quill with a knife. The lion at his feet, his symbolic animal, is looking into the chapel with his large eyes.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Sleeping Venus.jpg": "The first room was dominated by Annibale's Sleeping Venus, in which Annibale once again combines his mastery of the ideal style, quoting antique sculpture, with a witty penchant for echoing Michelangelo.",
    "images/BECCAFUMI, Domenico/View of the ceiling vault.jpg": "Besides the two central paintings there are three cycles with different themes, each of which is meant to be observed separately: ancient history in the six octagons that surround the central paintings, ten mythological depictions in the oculi, and twenty women in the lower corners of the spandrels, several  of whom immediately recognizable as famous heroines of antiquity.",
    "images/PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista/Three Dominican Saints.jpg": "The saint represented with wide gesture in the centre is St Vincent Ferrer.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Creation of Adam (1).jpg": "Seen against an indistinct natural background that is only just hinted at, as if it were the dawn of the world, the youthful, athletic figure reclining on a grassy slope, almost on the edge of an abyss, seems as if he is about to rise from the ground. He holds out his arm toward that of the Lord, who, borne aloft amidst a flight of angels, stands out brightly against the shell of shadow of his huge purple mantle. The remarkable invention of the outstretched arm and the forefingers   about to meet becomes a metaphor for the vital energy that passes from the Creator to the creature fashioned in his image, awakwening his heroic vigor.",
    "images/BRUEGHEL, Jan the Elder/Wooded River Landscape.jpg": "The painting depicts a wooded river landscape with a landing stage, boats, various figures and a village beyond. From a slightly elevated viewpoint, Brueghel opens a window onto early seventeenth-century Flemish life, particularly the daily life of a village settled on the edge of a river on a clear, crisp, summer's day. The left half of the composition is dominated by an expansive waterway that pulls the eye into the depths of the landscape. On the right half, balancing out the seemingly mirrored tranquility of the river and sky, is a bustling shoreline and landing site filled with colourful figures, animals, and remarkably drawn boats. Beyond and through the trees at right appears a quiet village with houses, wooden sheds, horse drawn carts, and, in the distance, the steeple of a church.",
    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg": "Bacchus took her jeweled crown and flung it into the heavens where it became a constellation.",
    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Famous Men of Antiquity (detail) (3).jpg": "The Cardinal Virtue Temperantia is above them.",
    "images/ROMNEY, George/Portrait of Lady Georgiana Smyth and her Son.jpg": "This portrait depicts Lady Georgiana Smyth (c. 1757-1799) and her son, John Henry (1780-1822).",
    "images/MAES, Nicolaes/Christ Blessing the Children.jpg": "In Maes's picture dark browns and blacks are enlivened with touches of cream and red - most striking in the cheeks of the little girl on whom Jesus has 'put his hands' and who turns around shyly and uncomprehendingly, finger in mouth. Her school slate hangs at her side - for these are seventeenth-century Dutch mothers and children who crowd around Jesus, although he, like Saint Peter standing rebuked behind the tree and the man lifting up the child (a disciple removing an infant, or a father jumping the queue?), is wearing 'timeless' dress. The young man awkwardly squeezed in at the left is likely to be a self portrait, a reminder that this picture is dated to Maes's late 'teens.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Birth of the Virgin.jpg": "In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted. The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption, namely (from the left). This picture shows the scene of the Birth of the Virgin.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Moses Receiving the Tables of the Law (detail).jpg": "On the peak of cloud-capped Mount Sinai, Moses, his arms outstretched in a Christ-like attitude, receives the two Tables of the Law brought to him by God and ten angels, some of them, as with Michelangelo's angels, without wings. In the blaze of God's aureole, Moses seems to become an astral body in an effect suggesting the transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor.",
    "images/BELLOTTO, Bernardo/Liechtenstein Garden Palace in Vienna Seen from the East (1).jpg": "This topographically correct view (and its companion piece Liechtenstein Garden Palace in Vienna Seen from the East) shows also Prince Joseph Wenzel standing in front of his suburban palace.",
    "images/GHERARDI, Filippo/Vault decoration (1).jpg": "The picture shows vault border scenes (trophies, weapons, armour, standards, and groups of Oriental figures) in the Grande Galleria in the Palazzo Colonna. They are part of the splendidly colourful decoration of the gallery, in which heraldic, ornamental, and figural motifs combine to create a dizzying spectacle.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Last Judgment Triptych (detail).jpg": "The detail from the central panel depicts the sin of Gluttony and its punishment. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/The Fountain of Youth (detail) (1).jpg": "Wrinkled and frail old women are brought up on carts and stretchers."
