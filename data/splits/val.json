    "images/RAMSAY, Allan/Prince George Augustus of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.jpg": "He is shown wearing the uniform of an officer of Cuirassiers, a unit of the 4th Regiment of Austrian-Salzburg Dragoons or 'Serbellonis' of which he was later Colonel from 1778 to 1786. The pale transparent flesh tones were the result of applying grey-green strokes over a red underpainting, while in the background the landscape appears to be veiled in mist. The head and shoulders have been painted on a separate piece of canvas that has been set into a larger piece, a practice much favoured by the artist.",
    "images/MAFFEI, Francesco/Perseus Beheading Medusa.jpg": "The figures, painted with impetuous, disdainful passion, crowd on the surface of the picture and are completely lacking in perspective relationship and in precise setting in their surroundings.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/St Matthew.jpg": "Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel. The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Eton College Chapel.jpg": "The college and its chapel are depicted as though seen from the east, across the river Thames. The view may not be an accurate record, but it is carefully composed, with the tree framing it at the left and a darkened foreground leading the eye of the viewer on into the middle-distance. The figures who fish, punt and stroll by the water effectively animate the scene.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife (detail) (5).jpg": "The portrayal of the woman's open right palm, facing the viewer, must have been very important to the painter, so much so, that he drew the man's left arm somewhat incorrectly: it is too short and the slightly upward turning wrist is anatomically incorrect.",
    "images/PITTONI, Giambattista/St Elizabeth Distributing Alms.jpg": "From the loose semi-circle of kneeling, sitting and recumbent paupers the white-robed figure of the princess stands out triumphantly, her outstretched arms bringing the groups of starving men and women into a close circle. The gestures are graceful and dainty, the proportions elongated, the colouring dominated by the pale blues and lemon-yellows favoured by Pittoni.",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Barbarigo Altarpiece.jpg": "The painting representing the Madonna and Child, St Mark, St Augustin and the kneeling Agostino Barbarigo, and musician angels is known as the Barbarigo Altarpiece. In the painting St Mark, with an expression of affectionate protection, presents the kneeling Agostino to the Virgin. According to the words of the Doge himself, both the background landscape and the walled fortress on the right (similar to the one in the Pesaro Altarpiece of some years before) refer semiologically to Mary. The withered tree, on the other hand, a symbol of death and of guilt that must be expiated, refer to the Doge's family disgrace.",

    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 33 Scenes from the Life of Christ 17. Mocking of Christ.jpg": "The contrast between the caricature-like figures and the introverted Christ, who has had the royal mantle wrapped round him in mockery, could not be greater. Two completely different worlds are depicted in the one picture. As in all the scenes which follow his arrest, Giotto also shows Christ here as a changed character: submissive and lacking all vitality.",
    "images/FLEGEL, Georg/Still-Life with Bread and Confectionary.jpg": "His painting shows candied fruit on a table in the foreground, including two figs on the right, encrusted with large sugar crystals. Some of the fruits have been cut up in the shape of letters, for example a large 'O' can be made out as well as a crumbled 'A' beside the loaf of bread. A straight piece of sugar is lying across the loaf like a cross-beam and is being approached by a disproportionately large bee. The earthenware bowl with the blue pattern contains candied fruit dusted with icing sugar, and a brimstone butterfly, whose wings also show traces of sugar, has alighted on it. The cross formed by the loaf and the piece of sugar emphasizes this aspect even further. Finally, as a reminder of the Eucharist, there is the bread and wine in the dainty glass, with decorations resembling amphora handles which drop down in the form of grape-like clusters at the bottom. The redemptive work of Christ is called to mind by the butterfly, an ancient symbol of the human soul as well of the resurrection, as new life comes forth from a seemingly dead chrysalis. The heart on the right is a specially shaped piece of bread, made from communion wafer dough, and is apparently meant to remind the viewer of the heart of Christ.",

    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Madonna del Cardellino.jpg": "This composition depicting the Virgin, Christ and the young John the Baptist holding a goldfinch is called Madonna del Cardellino (Madonna of the Goldfinch). The Christ Child is lovingly stroking a goldfinch that the boy Baptist has just given him. It is perhaps most visible in the sloping roofs and tall spires, unusual elements in a Mediterranean landscape. The influence of Michelangelo is again evident in the well structured figure of the infant Christ.",

    "images/VECCHI, Giovanni de'/View of the ceiling (1).jpg": "The decoration of this room consists of monumental maps of the entire known world as well as the depiction of the forty-eight Ptolemaic constellations. The program was completed with portraits of the great discoverers Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, and Hernando Cortés above the doors and windows of the room; personifications of the depicted countries and parts of the earth; and in a frieze, depictions of the celestial legends with which the ancients had explained the creation of the twelve signs of the zodiac.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Coronation of the Virgin (detail) (1).jpg": "The Virgin is a key focal point in the pictorial imagery. Of all the figures, she is the most illuminated, lit by a strong raking light from the left. She is clearly visible, isolated in the open space of the upper dais. Her rose and light blue garments stand out beside the darker red lake and ultramarine of the robes of God the Father. Her profile is barely visible.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Roundel.jpg": "This painting of a Young Man Holding a Roundel embodies Sandro Botticelli's greatest achievements as a portraitist. Were it not for his fashionable tunic, the supremely elegant individual depicted here could have stepped out of one of Botticelli's mythological or religious paintings, so striking is his resemblance to the beautiful figures that inhabit those works. One of this picture's most fascinating elements is the round, gold ground panel proudly held in the hands of the dashing young man - an older work of art set into the new.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian Salvaged.jpg": "This picture is the second from the left on the predella. In this scene the saints' prayer to God, the judge's attack by demons and their salvation by angels are represented in varied scale throughout the landscape to connote different moments in time. The undulating forms of the landscape recede and flatten as they approach the horizon, itself dissolved in the mist of atmospheric perspective.",
    "images/TEMPEL, Abraham van den/The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering'.jpg": "Here Minerva and Mercury return as witnesses of the principal scene in which the Maid of Leiden stands on a step in her purple gown and crimson mantel and extends a hand to Nering, while Liberty, with her broken weapons and the hat symbolising freedom, kneels at her feet. Under her arm Nering clutches a bound volume containing the statutes establishing the worsted nering in 1638.",

    "images/HACKERT, Jacob Philipp/Landscape with River.jpg": "The circular church is a bow to classic antiquity while the herd of goats and the shepherds resting under the tree are the representatives of the bucolic ideal.",
    "images/SCHICK, Christian Gottlieb/Heinrike Dannecker.jpg": "A young girl sits in profile, turning nonchalantly towards the audience. The background is soft, a random landscape, but she is vivid, the composition is balanced and graceful. Her vibrant blue dress and red vest pop out of the painting, and her luminous face gives off an expression of wistfulness and curiosity. Upon closer examination, it is Schick's tomb she sits upon. This likeness is startling for its brilliant colouring and decidedly anti-Classical, blonde, broad features.",
    "images/GOYA Y LUCIENTES, Francisco de/Majas on Balcony.jpg": "Supervised by the threatening figures of two heavily-cloaked 'majos', two 'majas' look down upon the passers-by. One even gives a hint of a smile, highly unusual for Goya's women.",
    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Doctor Gachet's Garden in Auvers.jpg": "Paul Gachet, a doctor specialising in nervous disorders, looked after the sick van Gogh during the last few weeks of his life. Dr. Gachet lived on a hill with his children in a house surrounded by high walls. The garden is densely overgrown with trees and plants. Towering, dark trees enclose the plot of land, permitting only the occasional glimpse of a neighbouring roof. In addition, the painter's viewpoint has been chosen in such a way that the large cypress in the background obstructs the view of the distant landscape and the sky.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/The Vision of St Helena (1).jpg": "The subject of the painting is the story of the vision, or more correctly the dream, which, according to legend, brought St Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine, to discover the True Cross in Jerusalem. The cross, which appears before her supported by a winged putto presenting his back to the audience, could be said to be the materialization of her dream. St Helena is seated in an attitude of repose, her head resting on her left hand, and her eyes closed. She wears a sumptuous gown, in sixteenth-century style, partly covered by a cloak fastened with a precious clasp. A jeweled crown secures the veil covering her head. St Helena is now crowned and wearing the splendid dress of an empress. Brightly gleaming columns with a statue between them ennoble the location of the event. In her dress, she seems a figure taken wholly from the repertoire of the Feasts.",
    "images/LORENZO DI NICCOLÒ DI MARTINO/Madonna and Child with Saints.jpg": "The panel represents the enthroned Madonna with the Child flanked by Sts Francis, Dorothy, Stephen, and a young male saint holding a spear.",
    "images/RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste/The Bathers.jpg": "The large painting which shows two voluminous women reclining at leisure in a lush landscape has the effect of an improvisation placed directly onto the canvas.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Perspective View with Portico (detail).jpg": "The subject - the entrance to a Venetian palazzo, complete with courtyard, grand staircase, and gallery - certainly gave the artist a vehicle for displaying his skill in perspective.",
    "images/FUMIANI, Giovanni Antonio/Martyrdom and Glory of St Pantaleon.jpg": "The scene on this huge ceiling decoration appears to want to suggest to worshippers the magnificence of the heavenly spaces in a crescendo of figures and animals arranged on various levels, reaching a climax with Saint Pantaleon.",

    "images/GIUSTO de' Menabuoi/Scenes from the Life of Christ (north wall).jpg": "On the four walls of the main space of the Baptistery the story of John the Baptist and scenes from the life of Christ are represented. These walls depict, on the south side, the life of John the Baptist, and on the opposite side, the life of Christ, which in part overlaps with the life of the Baptist. On the north wall the following scenes are depicted: The Birth of Christ (top left), The Adoration of the Magi (top middle), The Presentation in the Temple (top right), The Calling of Simon Peter and Andrew (middle left), The Calling of Matthew (middle), The Wedding at Cana (middle right), The Agony in the Garden (bottom left), The Arrest of Christ (bottom middle), Christ before the High Priest (bottom right).",
    "images/GRECO, El/Christ Healing the Blind (2).jpg": "The two seated figures in the middle ground were so thinly painted that the pavement is visible through them.",
    "images/LE NAIN brothers/Blacksmith at His Forge.jpg": "The smith himself looks towards the spectator as if he has been disturbed by the artist and asked to hold the pose while a photograph is taken. The other figures look in different directions, exactly as a group of people will do today when caught unawares by the camera. Especially perceptive is the depiction of the seated old man on the right - he is staring into space exactly as many old people tend to do, particularly when they are preoccupied with something which is not part of the event in front of them. The gazes of the three children are alert but lacking the concentration of the adults. The depiction of the better-off peasantry is interesting from a sociological point of view because there are so few renderings of that class, but, even more important, it showed that masterpieces could be produced from humble material.",
    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula (detail) (1).jpg": "All the characters, portraits of contemporaries, take part in this splendid interplay of forms, with their statuary solidity and their sense of physical movement; notice particularly the woman kneeling to the right, presumably a deceased member of the Caotorta family since she is portrayed set apart from the rest of the procession.",
    "images/LORENZETTI, Pietro/Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (detail).jpg": "A great deal of space is given to the varied and colourful urban views in the scenes Entry of Christ into Jerusalem, and Road to Calvary.",
    "images/CLAESZ., Jan/Portrait of a Young Child.jpg": "This painting, a characteristic example of the children’s portrait by Jan Claesz., depicts a young child wearing a lace collar and black dress, carrying a basket of cherries.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Eros and Anteros.jpg": "In the corners of the vault above the parapet four pairs of 'amoretti' can be seen wrestling with each other. The picture shows Eros and Anteros, love and reciprocal love fighting over which of the two is stronger and deserving of the victor's prize. They are found on either side of Polyphemus, whose love for Galatea was unrequited.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/The Parnassus (detail) (10).jpg": "The detail shows Sappho, who holds a scroll bearing her name.",

    "images/RESTOUT, Jean II/Pentecost (detail).jpg": "With its exaggerated view from below and the extreme perspective of the rows of columns to the left and right, the work is reminiscent of Baroque ceiling paintings.",
    "images/FRAGONARD, Alexandre-Évariste/Vivant Denon Replacing El Cid's Remains in their Tombs.jpg": "Denon had a passion for collecting relics of the great - bones of Abelard, a tooth of Voltaire, whiskers from Henri IV's moustache - and Fragonard depicts him replacing in its tomb, after an evidently minute examination, the skull of the semi-legendary eleventh-century Spanish hero El Cid.",
    "images/MELÉNDEZ, Luis/Portrait of the Artist.jpg": "The artist holds one of his drawings.",
    "images/TURA, Cosmè/Madonna with the Child Enthroned (detail) (1).jpg": "The usually neutral Renaissance architectural elements, for example, here alternate between green and pink, while the shell above the Virgin's throne is surprisingly fluid in design. At the top of the throne, statues of the symbols of the four evangelists join winged putti and cornucopias from which dangle bunches of grapes.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/The Four Corners of the World Asia.jpg": "On the ceiling of the nave St Ignatius is depicted in a state of ecstasy, and functions as a mediator between heaven and earth. Issuing from his heart are four rays of flame radiating outwards toward elaborate animated groupings representing the four corners of the globe. These personifications sit enthroned above monstrous giants.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 12 Scenes from the Life of the Virgin 6. Wedding Procession (detail).jpg": "Mary walks in front of her companions and is led to the house of her parents, where she is received by musicians. This group alone lends a cheery air to the sombre procession.",
    "images/RENI, Guido/Birth of the Virgin.jpg": "On the inner façade above the door the multifigured scene of Mary's birth is painted. The picture is structured into foreground, middle distance, and background. The influence of Dürer's woodcut is apparent inn the layout of the picture and the design of St Anne's bed in the background.",
    "images/DOMENICHINO/General view toward the choir.jpg": "The picture shows the general view toward the choir of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori in the Abbey of Santa Maria, Grottaferrata. The elegant row of columns between the chapel and the chancel creates a caesura in terms of subject matter. Between the columns one can see into the chancel, the centre of which is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels. The long walls are divided into two stories, each divided by a door into two rectangular spaces of different width. The events from the lives of the two founders are presented in a total of seven scenes. Three scenes are in the chancel, and four on the long walls of the main room. In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.",
    "images/INGRES, Jean-Auguste-Dominique/Madame Moitessier.jpg": "Ageless like a goddess with her Grecian profile impossibly reflected in a mirror parallel to the back of her head but dressed with Second Empire opulence in flowered chintz, Madame Moitessier exemplifies the ambiguities of Ingres's art. The firm contour of her shoulders, arms and face defines flesh perfectly rounded - though barely modelled - and as poreless, smooth and luminous as polished alabaster, yet paradoxically soft to the touch. The pose, with head resting against the right forefinger, derives from an ancient wall painting and signifies as Ingres must have known matronly modesty.",
    "images/VELDE, Peter van den/A View of Souda Island.jpg": "The painting shows a view of Souda Island, Crete with a Turkish galley and two Dutch ships.",

    "images/VERHOEVEN, Jan/Portrait of Jan Kadodder.jpg": "In the background of the painting Kauwendaal Castle is depicted.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/Virgin and Child with Angels.jpg": "The figure is cut in half, yet its sweeping Gothic lines are evident. The Virgin, surrounded by angels and wearing a gorgeous crown glittering with pearls and gems impersonates a remarkable type, namely the Madonna of the writing Christ Child. In her right she holds an inkhorn, a penholder is hanging from her wrist by a thin red cord; with an engaging gesture the Child catches hold of his mother's robe while obviously striving to get hold of the inkstand. In his other hand the Child holds a band covered with an illegible text; similar representations usually contain words which become Christ the teacher. The colouring is simple, but the garments are sumptuous as befits the queen of heaven and her retinue of angels, though the glitter of gold is seen only on their Lady. The angel plucking the strings of his lute with a lightly bent feather is wearing a cloak with an elaborate ornamental pattern obviously derived from garments seen on the most stylishly apparelled notabilities, while the silky locks of all the figures falling in rich curls bear evidence of the high standards of hair-dressing in that age.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/Marsilio Cassotti and His Bride Faustina.jpg": "The painter depicts the couple with a Cupid placing a yoke on their shoulders, a clear reference to the duties that each party undertakes in marriage. The stele was thought to represent the god Fidio, protector of truth; the image showed a man and a woman with right hands united, and behind and between them a young boy.",
    "images/LEYGEBE, Paul Carl/Tabakskollegium of Frederick I.jpg": "It shows the extravagant yet isolated character of the court of Prussia's first king.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Innocence Casting Out Deception.jpg": "The walls of the staircase ramps contain two polychrome scenes, Vigilance Triumphing over Sleep and Innocence Casting Out Deception, alluding to the Loschi family virtues.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Predella of the St Peter Martyr Altarpiece (detail).jpg": "The predella (now separated) of the St Peter Martyr Altarpiece depicts the Dead Christ with six saints, five of whom female. The holy women on the predella served as models for the piety of the sisters.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/St Anthony Preaching to the Fish.jpg": "In fact the artist has taken an original approach to the composition with the sweeping seascape that characterizes the entire scenes; the gulf on the left is balanced on the right by the figures of the saint and the bystanders, arranged on parallel planes and along a diagonal that indicates the depth of the space in which they move. The Franciscan saint, holding the traditional white lily, is represented standing on a tongue of land, preaching and pointing at the sea, where we can see the fish that have risen to the surface to hear his words. Anthony towers over the others; the pose, expressing the passion of his oratory, recalls that of many of Veronese's figures. His gesture, which serves to articulate the downward slope of the scene toward the edge, is echoed by the figures seen from the back, both the one in the middle, in a Manneristic attitude, and that of the Oriental in the foreground. The figures wearing turbans - as was customary in the art of Venice - render the sacred content of the representation \"ecumenical.\"",
    "images/BELLINI, Jacopo/St Bernardino da Siena.jpg": "His portrait gives us a close-up view of the saint who stands before a velvet cloth decorated with thistle leaves and Christ's monogram. The saint's mouth is open, displaying three small teeth, and his eyes are directed downward toward a crucifix. The saint is shown as a living, speaking presence, perhaps the first such portrait of the Renaissance. The Sienese preacher St Bernardino, a prominent figure in the reform branch of the Franciscan order known as the Observants, was widely portrayed. In addition to a death mask, there are medals, standing and bust-length painted depictions, terracotta busts and statues, and engravings.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/St Catherine.jpg": "The face of the saint, probably painted by an assistant, shows weaknesses in the drawing.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/St Lawrence Enthroned with Saints and Donors.jpg": "This painting was commissioned by Alessandro Alessandri (1391-1460), who is shown kneeling at the right, while his sons kneel at the left.",
    "images/ENGEBRECHTSZ., Cornelis/Christ Taking Leave of his Mother.jpg": "In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death. The second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance. The landscape and city in the background are painted in a surprisingly lively way. The steely, blue-white shapes of the mountains and rock formations contrast with the warm, bright colouring of the figures in the foreground.",
    "images/MASTER of Budapest/Crucifixion.jpg": "The background of the Crucifixion is of Franco-Flemish character the castle in its center symbolizes Jerusalem and Bethlehem.",

    "images/FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI/The Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "About 40 characters, each one visually identifiable thank to the artist's careful graphic research, crowd into the main scene. Christ is crowning the Virgin on a strange podium which is held up by angels. Above them, Francesco uses steep perspective to include a whirlwind image of God the Father. As a result, while one might expect to see the two kneeling saints from above or the central group of Christ and Mary from below, they are all seen almost straight on. Christ, the dominant image on the central axis, is in the act of crowning the kneeling and proportionally somewhat smaller Mary. His left arm, thrust across the body, forms a wedge below the nearly diamond-shaped head. A swirling God the Father, surrounded by zodiacal signs and angels, supervises the uppermost zone. Mary and Christ rest upon a flat cloud bank shown in sharp foreshortening (although the figures themselves are not foreshortened). On a ledge in the same zone, seated figures - including St John the Baptist cross-legged on the left and crowned King David holding his lyre on the right - and handsome angels imply a semicircular distribution in space, a compositional innovation that will find reverberations in the following decades. Along the sides, hosts of saints are piled up in the narrow vertical strips, recalling a Sienese tradition that goes as far back as Duccio di Buoninsegna's Maestà of the early Trecento. The spaces are hard to reconstruct; the surfaces are overcrowded; the colour strong although unnatural. The twisting, winged, nude putti of the Coronation, who help support the cloud bank, are modifications of Donatello's tiny angels in the Sienese Baptistery. Bodies are usually heavy, arbitrary, and abstract, without special attention to the light sources; for example, the St Dorothy standing on the extreme right edge of the picture with the flowers gathered in her garment. Her long face, accentuated by a strong chin and a wide-eyed expression, is curiously personalized, suggesting deep intensity and even an affliction, often found in Francesco's somewhat melancholy vision.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/The Gipsy Madonna.jpg": "This painting got its name from the black hair and pale face of the Madonna, as well as the charming contrast of colours.",
    "images/HOLLÓSY, Simon/Self-Portrait.jpg": "The artist, who experienced a lot of disappointments and who is still optimistic, is examining himself. A man approaching his final day, who has reconciled with his fate is looking into the eyes of the spectator to show what has become of his art.",
    "images/LORENZO DI CREDI/Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate.jpg": "The Madonna and Christ Child appear in a window, and the child is standing on the balustrade below it. She is holding a pomegranate that has been cut open out to him, and the boy has taken some of it, for he is showing Mary red pearls of fruit that he is holding in his clumsy child's hand. Mary appears melancholy, as if she knows about the future Passion of her son, symbolized by the pomegranate. The Christ Child as well, with his fat, tummy overlong torso and skinny little arms, refutes the widespread generally more rounded Florentine type of depiction.",

    "images/GENTILE DA FABRIANO/Polyptych of Valle Romita (detail) (1).jpg": "The left side of the polyptych shows in the lower part St Jerome and St Francis, while the upper part contains The Killing of St Peter Martyr and St John the Baptist in the Desert. In the lower part of the side panels, the bodies of the saints disappear within the fluid coils of their robes. The red, white and gold robe of St Jerome and the pink and violet costume of Mary Magdalene contrast with the more sober brown of St Francis' habit and the black of St Dominic's mantle. The feet of the other figures remain invisible, hidden by their robes and the thick carpet of flowers. St John the Baptist and St Francis, shown kneeling in profile, are squeezed in among rocky peaks without regard to realistic proportions. Similarly, St Anthony is placed in a narrow garden, hemmed in by the wall and the door,  emphasizing the atmosphere of private meditation.",

She is dressed in a white tunic which exposes her left breast. In her upraised right hand she delicately holds a small bouquet of various flowers, composed of anemones, daisies, and buttercups, which she appears to offer the viewer with a self-assured gaze.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Eleazar - Matthan (detail) (2).jpg": "Eleazar, father of Matthan is generally believed to be the young man on the right. His head is seen in profile, and he appears to be immersed in his thoughts; his torso is seen frontally; his legs are crossed; his left arm is outstretched, his wrist lying across his raised right ankle, while his right arm, resting on a yellow cushion, is folded, his hand touching his shoulder. Behind him are visible the heads of a woman and a child.",

    "images/POST, Frans/Brazilian Landscape (detail).jpg": "In this painting, there are seven women, six children, and six men, all natives. The women bear rectangular baskets on their heads and backs, the latter supported by straps slung from the forehead. At least two of the women have dead birds in their hands. The second and third women from the left carry infants. The young woman sitting on the ground has evidently lost control of her basket, to the irritation of the woman on the right. Four of the men carry bows and long arrows, while two of them shoulder muskets and wear cartridge belts.",
    "images/LEYDEN, Lucas van/Card Players (1).jpg": "In this case the figure on the left would be Emperor Charles V and on the right Cardinal Wolsey, and both would be entering into a secret agreement between Spain and England against Francis I of France.

Below them is the earth, from which the resurrected souls emerge, to go either to damnation or to eternal bliss. The damned souls among them, crying out  in despair, move of their own accord toward the fiery mouth of Hell. The limbs of the angular nude figures, still very Gothic in concept, create a complex interlocking pattern.",

    "images/GRECO, El/The Holy Family (3).jpg": "The inclusion of the young John the Baptist, pointing heavenwards with the index finger of his left hand, allows the painting to be seen as a vision of the future Passion. St Anne, her daughter's arm lying around her shoulders, is bending down over the infant Jesus lying in his mother's lap a reminder of Pietà representations and thus again of the Passion of Christ. Joseph, complementary to St Anne, looks towards Christ from behind. The robes are treated broadly, while contours and outlines are blurred something particularly apparent in the modelling of the two children. El Greco is already moving towards the style of his late work, in which he would increasingly turn away from the portrayal of idealized nature.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO/St Julian and the Redeemer.jpg": "The figure of the saint is no longer the sophisticated gentleman we saw in the Berlin Madonna: he is simply a young man who is sincerely contrite for the harm he has caused. Above his hair, rendered with golden highlights, the metallic halo realistically reflects the saint's head. Above Julian, partly concealed by pinkish clouds, Christ imparts his blessing. On either side of the saint, in the midst of a lovely Tuscan landscape, Andrea has illustrated some episodes from his life.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Josiah - Jechoniah - Shealtiel.jpg": "(Matthew 1:10-12)  Josiah, the son of Amon, is usually considered to be the man depicted on the right, and Jechoniah the child that he holds on his knees, while, on the opposite side, the child's mother is believed to be holding in her arms another of the sons begotten by Josiah during the Babylonian Captivity. In particular, this was assigned to the postures of the two children leaning eagerly toward each other with outstretched arms: the one on his father's lap holds a small object that is no longer recognizable, while the other seems to be trying to grasp it. The man suddenly turns his head with a vigorous mien that is difficult to interpret - possibly he is surprised, as his open left hand would seem to indicate - while the woman suddenly draws back, clasping her son more tightly as if to protect him better, with an expression of great alarm on her face. And, once again, the brighter colours of the woman's figure - a deep rose dress with a green scarf round her waist, a white shirt and a yellow ocher mantle - are in marked contrast with the dominant darker tones of the green cloak with violet shadows that envelops the man.",
    "images/VASARI, Giorgio/The Prophet Elisha.jpg": "The subject is a scene from the life of the Prophet Elisha, who during famine saved his people making edible wild herbs.

    "images/PERUGINO, Pietro/Famous Men of Antiquity (1).jpg": "Each of the two compartments (lunettes) on the left wall presents a row of six figures standing in front of a low landscape horizon. Above these, personifications of the four cardinal virtues sit enthroned on clouds, two in each lunette. Beside each of the Virtues is an ornamental inscription tablet flanked by putti and containing a Latin distich identifying her and celebrating the exemplars below. Each trio of figures is made up of two Romans and one Greek; their names appear on the ground beneath their feet. The represented famous men in the first compartment are Fabius Maximus, Socrates, Numa Pompilius, Furius Camillus, Pittacus, and Trajan.

    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Pilate's First Interrogation of Christ (scene 13).jpg": "The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maestà. It is situated in the bottom row on the right side below the scene of Christ Accused by the Pharisees. The slender spiral columns of white marble and the decoration carved along the top of the walls seem to refer to classical architecture. Pilate too, portrayed with the solemnity of a Roman emperor and crowned with a laurel wreath, evokes the world of classical antiquity. As in the gospel, the group of Pharisees, animated by lively gestures (again the hand with pointing finger), is depicted outside the building: the Jews avoid going inside in order not to be defiled and to be able to eat the Passover meal.",
    "images/ZAMACOIS Y ZABALA, Eduardo/Jesters Playing Cochonnet.jpg": "In this case the jesters are playing cochonnet, a French game played in pairs in which a smaller ball (the cochonnet or piglet) is thrown out as a target, followed by other different coloured boules that are supposed to land as close as possible to it. In a motley composition, the jesters - whose mission was to entertain - have left their belongings and appear idle while they dispute in a carefree manner over which boule got the closest and therefore is the winner. The prominence of commonplace features is highlighted by the contrast between the idea of transcendence, represented by the historical relief of the background, and the triviality of the game practiced by the jesters.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/The Circumcision.jpg": "The subject of this painting is the circumcision of Christ eight days after birth, therefore on New Year's Day. Joseph is carrying a sacrifice of two doves in a basket. The setting is richly decorated.

Nativity Birth of Christ.jpg": "The simple shelter under which the Virgin and her Child seek refuge is situated in the middle of a bleak rocky landscape. Mary turns on her side on the bed in order to receive the new-born baby from the arms of a midwife — a natural and spontaneous gesture, which is captured by the way mother and child look at one another.",
    "images/OS, Georgius van/Still-Life of Fruit.jpg": "The painting, signed and dated lower centre, depicts a still-life of fruit including melons, grapes, a pomegranate, plums and peaches, together with nuts, red peppers, flowers, a snipe and a partridge, all upon a ledge.",

The young Duke of Flanders weeps at this news, but Conradin and Frederick display only irritation at the interruption of their chess game.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Feast in the House of Levi.jpg": "The sumptuous banquet scene is framed by the great arches of a portico. Against the pale green shotsilk effect of the background architecture, the figures on either side of Christ move in a turbulence of polychromatic splendour and interaction of pose and gesture.",

The scene is populated by over one hundred colourful, individually defined figures and the spectacular architectural setting is unified by a warm, soft light that is both naturalistic and atmospheric.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Portrait of Jacob Obrecht.jpg": "This portrait represents the renowned composer Jacob Obrecht. Jacob Obrecht has longish chestnut-brown hair, fairly robust features, and wears a transparent surplice over a brownish toga. The dark green collar with black lining is folded under the surplice on one side, revealing the black collar of the laced-up waistcoat beneath. He has a grey fur almuce about his left wrist, the standard attribute of the canons of a chapter church. He is shown in three-quarter view against a light blue-green background. The reverse features a standing female figure in grisaille, wearing a long dress, and reading from an open book which she holds at waist height.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Portrait of a Senator.jpg": "The senator is depicted as serious, austere and severe. His penetrating gaze is fixed on the viewer. He is dressed in ermine-lined robe of office and seems to emerge from the darkness, the black background seems to reinforce the sombre way in which he is depicted.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Hendrickje Stoffels Bathing.jpg": "There are overtones in this picture of the biblical subject of either Bathsheba or Susanna and the Elders; this much is made clear by the heavy gold and red cloak behind the figure and by the grotto-like setting. The young woman appears completely absorbed in her bathe and shows no sign of the reactions appropriate to either Susanna or Bathsheba. The small Woman bathing in a Stream is so tenderly intimate, so informal in pose and spontaneous in technique that it appears at first sight like the record of an actual experience: Rembrandt's mistress Hendrickje Stoffels wading in a stream. But the gold and crimson robe lying on the bank suggests that the bathing woman should be read as a biblical or mythological figure, Susanna, Bathsheba or Diana.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Younger/Double Portrait of Sir Thomas Godsalve and His Son John (detail).jpg": "Using a pen held in his right hand, 47-year-old Thomas Godsalve from Norwich has just written his name and age in Latin on a piece of paper.",

    "images/TINTORETTO/Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery.jpg": "In his painting of the encounter of Christ and the woman taken in adultery, Tintoretto provides a literal depiction of the biblical account (in John 8: 1 -11): the adulteress stands \"in the midst\" before Christ, who is seated in the temple preaching, and his disciples; on the right, the scribes and Pharisees are leaving the scene of their defeat, \"beginning with the eldest, even unto the last.\"",

The left scene is set in an earthly forest, the right in the flowering garden of heaven. The monarch wears around his neck the white hart badge which Richard adopted in 1390 as his personal insignia. Both it and the French insignia of broom-cods (seed-pods) are woven into the king's iridescent gold mantle. One of them holds the banner of St George.",

Participants in the Council session are spread row upon row across the top of the composition, their faces directed forward or turned in profile as if to record as completely and accurately as possible the individual members. At the lower right of this pictorial chronicle of the event, however, allegorical personifications of the virtues crown a figure representing the Roman Church with a papal tiara. A globe at the lower left shows Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. Thus the Church appears not only victorious, but extending far beyond Europe, where Protestantism had recently made such dramatic inroads.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/House Altarpiece (open).jpg": "This small house altarpiece consists of a predella, a central shrine, and a superstructure. Depicted on the predella is Veronica's kerchief, or sudarium, with which she wiped the face of Christ as he carried the Cross, whereupon the cloth miraculously took on the image of his face. Within the central shrine are sculptures in nearly full relief representing St Anne holding the diminutive Virgin in her left arm and in her right the naked Christ Child. Flanking the holy group are a kneeling female and male figure on the left and right, respectively. The shrine is flanked by two painted wings on metal hinges. When the altarpiece is open, St Catherine on the left wing and St Barbara on the right wing are visible with their respective attributes.",

    "images/VERNET, Claude-Joseph/Capriccio view of Montferrat.jpg": "The picture shows a capriccio view of Montferrat at dawn with the Gorges du Verdon and the River Nartuby, with fishermen unloading their catch in the foreground. The village of Montferrat in the Var in south-east France is a location that lends itself perfectly to Vernet's grand natural landscapes, the village itself perched precariously on a cliff edge in the dramatic Gorges du Verdon.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife.jpg": "Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand. Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage.",

    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (left wing).jpg": "On the left wing the last three days of Creation are accomplished. The earth and water have brought forth their swarms of living creatures, including a giraffe, an elephant, and some wholly fabulous animals, like the unicorn. In the centre rises the Fountain of Life, a tall, slender roseate structure resembling a delicately carved Gothic tabernacle. The precious gems glittering in the mud at its base and some of the more fanciful animals probably reflect the medieval descriptions of India, whose marvels had fascinated the West since the days of Alexander the Great and where popular belief situated the lost Paradise of Eden. In the foreground of this antediluvian landscape, we see the union of Adam and Eve by Christ. Taking Eve by the hand, he presents her to the newly awakened Adam who gazes at this creation from his rib with a mixture of surprise and anticipation.",

Next to her is a young and very beautiful saint, who is probably Henry, Prince of Hungary (and not Louis IX of France, as had been suggested: how could he be a king without a crown?), the son of St Stephen, shown on the next wall with St Ladislaus and the Madonna and Child.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Uzziah - Jotham - Ahaz.jpg": "The boy in the foreground, in front of the woman, reinforces the plastic equilibrium of the scene; and there is decidedly sculptural and monumental emphasis in the two groups that seem to be compressed into the limited space of the lunette. Under a loose green mantle, the man on the left - traditionally considered to be Jotham accompanied by his son Ahaz - is wearing a yellow tunic with lilac shadows on the shoulder and arm; these echo the colour of his cap, which is tied to his head with purple ribbons. In a relaxed attitude, leaning forward with his arm resting in his lap, he gazes with parted lips at a point that the boy behind him is indicating. The right part of the lunette is dominated by the tonality of the heavy reddish-orange mantle with deep yellow shadows that the woman presses to her breast. Although her gaze is not directed at them, she seems to be protective toward the two children by her.",
    "images/HONTHORST, Gerrit van/Granida and Daifilo.jpg": "She came upon a shepherd Daifilo and his mistress Dorilea who had just quarrelled. In Van Honthorst's representation the lovers are depicted in a woodland setting, with the suitor and soldiers approaching to arrest Daifilo.",

The picture shows part of the mural frescoes with inscription.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Last Judgment (1).jpg": "The first impression we have when faced with the Last Judgment is that of a truly universal event, at the centre of which stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the lefthand side, who are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld; while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength. Together with the planets and the sun, the saints surround the Judge, confined into vast spacial orbits around Him. The figures who, in the depths of the scene, are rising from their graves could well be part of the prophet Ezechiel's vision. Naked skeletons are covered with new flesh, men dead for immemorable lengths of time help each other to rise from the earth. Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coal/Beckoning them, collects them all,/Smites with his oar whoever lingers. The artist's self-portrait appears twice: in the flayed skin which Saint Bartholomew is carrying in his left-hand, and in the figure in the lower left hand corner, who is looking encouragingly at those rising from their graves.",
    "images/PEREDA, Antonio de/The Knight's Dream.jpg": "A young nobleman has fallen asleep in an armchair on the left, his head, pale with sleep, supported by one hand. The content of his dream - the world and its vanity - is displayed on the table on the right, against a pitch-black background. Other objects of vanity, apart from the power insignia mentioned above, are books, music, coins, jewellery, weapons and a mask (as a symbol of Thalia - the theatre). Transience is symbolized by two skulls - one of them rolled over so that we can see inside - as well as by a burnt candle and a clock. The flowers in the vase, too, are symbols of vanity. A winged angelic creature has come flying to the scene, opening up a banner which reads 'Aeterne pungit, cito volat et occidit.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Bohemian/St Bartholomew and St Thomas.jpg": "The Madonna and Child may have been in the centre of the surviving right-hand part, while on the left further saints and the praying figure of the donor may have completed the composition. The Apostles Bartholomew and Thomas are standing on a narrow strip of ground in front of a shining golden background. Their figures are surrounded by abundant intricate draperies, whose edges of soft lines, corners and folds which tumble down like waterfalls seem to live a separate life independent of the bodies. The bright colours of the two saints' cloaks complement one another-as do the hues of the linings. The pink lining of the green cloak and the blue lining of the red one serve a purely decorative function. The right-hand edge of St Bartholomew's draperies, forming a gently wavy line and the straight left-hand contour of St Thomas's mantle, which appears to continue the line of the spear, run very near each other. This narrow stripe turns the two figures into a form springing from the same basis and bending in two opposite directions. At the bottom the formation is completed by the green cloak flowing into the red one, while at the top it is enclosed by the tips of the flaying knife and of the spear which touch each other.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The young man, who is looking very slightly down towards the observer, is wearing a red jerkin and the characteristic headgear of the Florentine Quattrocento, the mazzocchio.

There is one markedly commonplace and bourgeois detail in the scene, which must create the sense of a heroic-pathetic atmosphere: the presence of a night vase under the bed.",
    "images/BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger/Two Peasant Couples.jpg": "The subjects may depict events before, during and after a peasant wedding.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Annibale/Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne (detail).jpg": "In the bridal procession of Bacchus and Ariadne, which fills the central area of the ceiling, these qualities merge to the most highly condensed composition of the Farnese Gallery.",
    "images/FONTEBASSO, Francesco/The Banquet of Zenobia (detail) (2).jpg": "The detail shows the small orchestra that entertains the assembly.",
    "images/LANFRANCO, Giovanni/Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels.jpg": "In keeping with the character of the building, a casino in a garden, they represented mythological episodes.",
    "images/TASSI, Agostino/Imaginary Landscape with Temple of Sibyl at Tivoli.jpg": "His skies, with their diagonal streaks of pink, can often be seen in Roman sunsets. His imposing beeches and elegant umbrella pines are truly those of the Roman countryside.",
    "images/VIVARINI, Alvise/St John the Baptist.jpg": "The cool crystalline palette, the subtly agitated brushwork, and the depth of the bare, timeless landscape at the feet of the Saint make this painting (together with the other panel representing St Matthew) one of the artist's most evocative works.",
    "images/NETSCHER, Caspar/Portrait of Suzanna Huygens.jpg": "Suzanna Huygens is depicted standing three-quarter length in white satin with an evening landscape in the background.",
    "images/BRAY, Jan de/Haarlem Printer Abraham Casteleyn and His Wife Margarieta van Bancken.jpg": "There is an autograph drawing by Jan de Bray in which Margarieta van Bancken is pointing at an overgrown archway through which two children can be seen climbing some steps carrying produce from the garden.",
    "images/BALEN, Hendrick van/Feast of the Gods.jpg": "The painting may represent the wedding banquet of Peleus and Thetis, the parents of the Greek hero Achilles, which was attended by the gods of Olympus.",
    "images/VERSPRONCK, Jan Cornelisz/Girl in a Blue Dress.jpg": "This subtle and charming portrait of a young girl holding an ostrich-feather fan is one of Verspronck's most outstanding works. The delicately modelled face and the careful detailing of the dress and jewels set it apart from the work of Hals and give it a quite individual and striking effect.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DA MILANO/Three pinnacle panels.jpg": "The three panels representing the Virgin, the Apocalyptic Christ (Son of Man), and St John the Baptist, come from a single altarpiece painted for an unknown location. Above each figure is a seraph in a quatrefoil.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/St Augustine at the University of Carthage (scene 2, north wall).jpg": "St Augustine is kneeling on the right side in front of two seated scholars. Between them, in the background, appear two youthful figures framed by a classical pediment portal.",

    "images/BOL, Hans/Mountainous Landscape with the Return of Jacob from Canaan (detail).jpg": "During his journey home from Canaan, Jacob encounters a group of shepherds near a well awaiting the stone to be removed to water their flocks. It is here that Jacob will soon meet and fall in love with his future wife, Rachel, who can be seen approaching the group with her flock of sheep.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/St Francis Altarpiece (central panel).jpg": "The central panel shows St Francis receiving the stigmata, and also other scenes from his legend. On the left wing are Sts John Capistran and Bonaventura; on the right wing Sts Louis of Toulouse and Bernard of Siena (not illustrated). On the exteriors are St Francis and five Moroccan martyrs of the Order (not illustrated).",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/Portrait of a Man (1).jpg": "This dated half-length portrait of an unidentified man shows the sitter seated before a dark green curtain that is drawn back from the right to reveal a castle on a rocky crag.",
    "images/BOSSCHAERT, Johannes/Still-Life (1).jpg": "The picture shows a still-life with an overturned basket of flowers. The artist has arranged a basket of flowers on a wooden table facing the viewer. He arranged the flowers as he pleases, charmingly combining the daintiness of the tulips, roses and irises. A china bowl filled with fruit counterbalances the composition with the help of delicious colours.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/The Lamentation over the Dead Christ.jpg": "Looking in we see an almost monstrous spectacle: a heavy corpse, seemingly swollen by the exaggerated foreshortening. At the front are two enormous feet with holes in them; on the left, some tear-stained, staring masks. The face of Christ, like the other faces, is seamed by wrinkles, which harmonize with the watery satin of the pinkish pillow, the pale granulations of the marble slab and the veined onyx of the ointment jar. The damp folds of the shroud emphasize the folds in the tight skin, which is like torn parchment around the dry wounds. All these lines are echoed in the wild waves of the hair. He has a tragic sense of the history and destiny of man, and of the problems of good and evil, life and death.",
    "images/LE SUEUR, Eustache/Death of St Bruno.jpg": "The emotion is aroused by the dignity of the monks and by the sobriety of the coloured harmonies.",
    "images/VALENTIN DE BOULOGNE/Christ Driving the Money Changers out of the Temple.jpg": "Everything is arranged along diagonals, carefully studied to give an overall sensation of whirling motion. Isolated in the centre of all this is the powerful figure of Christ. With his arm raised against a terrorized, fleeing crowd, this figure a very individual interpretation of its prototype, the Christ at the centre of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Last Judgment.",
    "images/CECCO DI PIETRO/St Simon.jpg": "Four panels representing full-length saints - Sts Peter, Simon, Rainerius and a bishop saint - have formed part of a larger altarpiece complex flanking a central panel.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Allegory of Merit Accompanied by Nobility and Virtue.jpg": "The ceiling in the Room of the Throne represents the Allegory of Merit Accompanied by Nobility and Virtue, Ascends to the Temple of Immortal Glory. Merit is depicted as an old, bearded man, crowned with laurel, he is accompanied in his ascent toward the circular temple of Glory by Nobility, the winged figure holding a lance, and by Virtue, the elegantly dressed figure to the right. Other allegorical figures and some swirling putti witness the scene, in which Fame also participates, sounding a trumpet above. One of the winged putti, located just under the figure of Merit, holds the Golden Book of Venetian Nobility in which the names of families that could claim a Venetian patrician were listed, and where, beginning in 1687, the Rezzonico name was also inscribed.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Massacre of the Innocents.jpg": "Herod, with crown and sceptre, watches from above the infanticide he has ordained. The sinister, dark-clad soldiers pour through the archway wielding black daggers against the children. The mothers, shown in a great variety of terrified postures and with looks of horror, attempt to protect their infants, but to no avail.",
    "images/GIRODET DE ROUCY-TRIOSON, Anne-Louis/François-René de Chateaubriand.jpg": "In the still Italian air, Chateaubriand's hair is windswept (Napoleon mischievously said the portrait looked like that of a conspirator who had come down a chimney), hinting at the storms and passions that had lashed his best-known creation.",
    "images/GAROFALO/Virgin and Child with Saints (detail).jpg": "The detail shows the figure of Archangel Michael.",
    "images/HOBBEMA, Meyndert/Road on a Dyke.jpg": "The Road on a Dyke shows him placing themes taken from Ruisdael - the pool surrounded by trees, the large over-arching oak dominating the landscape; the country path rutted by the wheels of waggons - in an open, sunlit landscape. The figures and cattle in the right foreground are probably by Adriaen van de Velde, who often collaborated with Hobbema and other landscape painters.",
    "images/BURGKMAIR, Hans/St John Altarpiece St John the Evangelist in Patmos (central panel).jpg": "The side wings represent the bishop saints Erasmus and Martin in an extended landscape.",
    "images/MAES, Nicolaes/Eavesdropper with a Scolding Woman.jpg": "In this witty picture a maid quietly smiles at us as she points to the room upstairs, making us complicitous in overhearing a scolding mistress. To the left, utensils have tumbled over, lying idle. By opening the curtain, the painter literally reveals a badly managed household: the maid spends more time listening than working, and the mistress does not create domestic harmony.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Portrait of a Venetian Woman.jpg": "The eyes have been restored. Some object is discernible in the curl hanging to the left. Only a few traces of the hairnet have been preserved, and the sky blue of the background, which is inexplicably divided into two sections, is probably no longer its original shade.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/Christ Blessing, Surrounded by a Donor Family.jpg": "In this triptych a family of seven gathers closely around the central figure of Christ as Salvator Mundi. The table in the centre is strewn with cut flowers.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Last Judgment Triptych (detail) (6).jpg": "The figure of St Michael stands on the earth directly below Christ, on the dividing line between the green soil to the left and the barren brown plain to the right. He wears a suit of armour in the same gleaming golden material as the globe on which Christ's feet rest. A red brocade cope hangs from his shoulders. His wings end in peacock feathers. Holding the scales in his right hand, he uses the crosier in his left to prick the flesh of the damned soul, as if to prod him towards the mouth of hell. Around him, as far as the eye can see, the dead rise up from their graves. St Michael's curved breastplate and the globe reflect the unfolding events with hallucinatory precision (only here do we see clearly how the Romanesque towers loom up behind the Gothic heavenly gates).",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Self-Portrait (2).jpg": "This unfinished self-portrait shows a man not quite thirty, a stylish man of the middle class, with gloves and top hat, facing whatever the future may have in store with calm self-assurance.",
    "images/VRIES, Roelof van/The Pigeon House.jpg": "The Pigeon House shows a few peasants going about their daily business, such as the fisherman who works in his boat, and the old lady going down to the river to meet him. On the edge of the bank is an old pigeon house, a run-down and dilapidated building. The painting shows a small corner of village life, focusing in and concentrating on the landscape, and is contextualized by the human activity that takes place within it.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Interior View of the Henry VII Chapel, Westminster Abbey (detail).jpg": "Canaletto has chosen a viewpoint from an angle along the central nave of the chapel looking towards the tomb of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. The grille surrounding the tomb can be seen at the far end of the chapel. Heraldic banners belonging to the Knights of the Order of Bath hang over the stalls and east end of the building. The awe-inspiring architecture is the main focus, though the artist has included a few figures who serve to emphasize the scale and grandeur of the interior.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Marriage of Mary.jpg": "On the second level, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Marriage of Mary stand side by side. the youths angrily breaking their rods, which did not flower like that of Joseph. Looking as though it has been slotted in from above, the architecture does not really look inhabited by the figures. The most remarkable figures are themselves outside the main group, at the edges of the pictorial field; it is thought that the women's figures on the left are most likely to be Ghirlandaio's own work.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Boy with a Basket of Fruit.jpg": "The boy with a fruit basket has analogies with a Fruit Seller by the Lombard painter Vincenzo Campi, painted about 1580, but Caravaggio is not content to follow the traditions on which he draws. Instead of the young women favoured by his predecessors, he has chosen a teenage boy; and he has brought his subject almost to the front of the picture plane, so that the boy seems to offer himself as well as the fruit to the spectator's gaze. There is a sign of uncertainty in the awkward way that the boy's long thick neck rises out of his shoulder blades, yet there is compensation in the poetic device which places his weary eyes partially in the shade. Against a near-blank ground, attention is focused on the right side of the boy's upper body, the classical drapery on his right arm and the marvellously realized fruit, displaying succulent peaches and bunches of grapes.",
    "images/BASSANO, Jacopo/The Last Supper.jpg": "Instead of the elegant grouping of figures in Leonardo's painting, which inspired it, this dramatic scene features barefoot fishermen at the crucial moment when Christ asks who will betray him, and the light passing through a glass of wine stains the clean tablecloth red.",
    "images/POLLAIUOLO, Piero del/Faith.jpg": "Faith is personified as a young woman, captured as she looks up to the heavens, holding the calyx of the eucharist in her right hand, covered by the paten, while the processional cross is in her left.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Ballroom ceiling (detail).jpg": "The richly painted cornice, decorated with imitattion statues of Atlas, vases of flowers, and musical instruments, opens onto an oval of sky illuminated by the arrival of Aurora's dazzling chariot.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/Heller Altar (detail).jpg": "In the center-ground of the landscape, Dürer stands as usual with the explicative tablet and his gaze fixed straight ahead. The background presses into the far distance, toward a lake enclosed by hills, peppered with buildings.",
    "images/POST, Frans/The Ox Cart.jpg": "But for its inclusion of workers of African origin and the exotic tree, his Ox Cart resembles near-contemporary Dutch pictures.",
    "images/WEST, Benjamin/Portrait of Prince William and His Elder Sister, Princess Sophia.jpg": "It portrays Prince William (1776-1834),",
    "images/BELLINI, Giovanni/Madonna degli Alberetti.jpg": "The curtain behind the Virgin captures the light coming from in front of her in such a way that the shadow of her figure is projected onto the fabric. In the landscape background beyond, on the other hand, the light expands totally independently in an even, diffused luminosity. The two small trees, or alberetti, on either side of the Virgin that give the painting its name may allude to the Song of Solomon or, in contrast with the dead bushes next to them, the Old and New Testaments.",
    "images/VERBEECK, Cornelis/Coastal Scene.jpg": "This small panel depicts a coastal scene with war ships and fishing vessels, with figures on the shore.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/St John the Evangelist.jpg": "At the sides of the altar in the sacristy of the Santa Maria della Salute, there are eight tondi by Tiziano, painted originally for the monastery of Santo Spirito. They portray the Four Evangelists: St Matthew, St Mark, St Luke and St John, as well as the Doctors of the Church: St Jerome, St Augustine, St Ambrose, and St Gregory the Great.",
    "images/UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Russian/Icon of the Transfiguration.jpg": "On the mount are Christ in His glorious radiance and the Prophets Elijah and Moses conversing with him; below are apostles astonished by the miracle, Peter kneels in amazement and John and James fall dazzled by the light. On the light blue background and light ochre mountain he boldly laid thick, bright colours-green and red, yellow and brown, white, and dark to the point of blackness.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Raising of Lazarus.jpg": "In the lower half enveloped in half-shadow Martha, the sister of Lazarus who is plastically outlined by the thread of light, stretches out her arms and stares motionless and as if unbelieving at Christ who sits down calm and unmoved after pronouncing the life-giving words. She is outlined from behind and her lost profile makes her very beautiful. At the top, among the leafy branches of the trees clearly outlined against the glow of the sky mingled with pink and blue-grey light, Lazarus, who is coming back to life, is freed from the bandages under the careful gaze of the crowd of spectators just made out beyond the small hill.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/A Young Woman and Her Little Boy.jpg": "Her ornate and costly attire establish her as an aristocrat. Tucked in the corner of the panel, the small blond boy was an afterthought, added by Bronzino in a second campaign of painting.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/San Domenico Altarpiece (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows the right side of the altarpiece representing Sts Dominic and Peter Martyr.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/Pallas and the Centaur (detail).jpg": "The centaur looks worriedly at the somewhat taller woman standing next to him, who is imperiously grabbing at his hair.",
    "images/OUDRY, Jean-Baptiste/Misse and Luttine.jpg": "Their staff managed the packs of boisterous, often frenzied dogs that pursued large prey or sniffed out wild birds and other small game. The painter was to portray these animals posing sedately, pointing game, or striding across a landscape.",
    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/The Infant Samuel.jpg": "In earthy shades of brown, he shows Samuel, the last judge and first prophet of Israel, as a child.",
    "images/SAVERY, Roelandt/Alpine Landscape with Torrent and Hunter.jpg": "There he made drawings of mountains, fantastic rock formations, waterfalls and a variety of flora and fauna.",
    "images/HERRERA, Francisco de, the Younger/Stigmatisation of St Francis.jpg": "He conceives the subject as a surging apotheosis of the saint, who is carried triumphantly aloft by a convoy of angels and putti.",
    "images/FRIEDRICH, Caspar David/Winter Landscape.jpg": "In the bleak Schwerin picture, a tiny figure on crutches stares out across a snow-covered plain. He is surrounded by the gnarled trunks of dead or dying oaks, and stumps of felled trees stretch away into the distance. Here the same cripple has abandoned his crutches. He leans against a sturdy rock, raising his hands in prayer before a crucifix gleaming against the vigorous evergreen branches of young fir trees. On the horizon the facade and spires of a Gothic church, whose silhouette echoes that of the firs, rise like a vision out of a bank of mist. Shoots of grass push through the snow, and the sky is streaked with the glow of dawn.",
    "images/GUALTIERO PADOVANO/Hall of the Triumphs (detail) (3).jpg": "This detail of the frescoes in the Hall of the Triumphs shows a landscape with the Ideal View of Rhodes (with the Colossus of Rhodes).",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Pan and the Hours.jpg": "Fresco decoration appears on the ceiling of the ballroom, in three compartments with ornate frames that are elegantly interwoven with luxuriant, gilded oak branches. The elongated central compartment contains the Bacchanal, a rustic and lively scene. In the compartment toward the window overlooking the street, Pan appears with the Hours, while in the compartment on the other side, toward the garden, Pan Uncovering the Nakedness of a Sleeping Nymph is represented. Enveloped in a long vegetal festoon and accompanied by a white goat, he seems annoyed by two irreverent cupids. He is taken by surprise at the sight of two graceful, transparent Hours hovering in the sky.",
    "images/BEERSTRATEN, Jan Abrahamsz/Skating at Sloten, near Amsterdam.jpg": "They are usually winter landscapes with ice skaters and other figures in the foreground.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Matthaeus Yrsselius, Abbot of Sint-Michiel's Abbey in Antwerp.jpg": "In his portrait, Matthaeus Yrsselius (1541-1629) wears the white habit of the Premonstratensians with the mitre and the crosier by his side.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Ballet at the Paris Opéra.jpg": "The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers' zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, en pointe, but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers' free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The picture is signed, lower left, in white pastel: \"Degas\".",
    "images/PAOLO VENEZIANO/Polyptych (detail).jpg": "The picture shows the left side of the polyptych with the scenes 'The Adoration of the Magi', 'The Baptism of Christ', 'The Last Supper' and 'The Prayer in the Garden and the Arrest of Christ'. Above these scenes, set between Evangelists, are scenes depicting, from left to right: 'Pentecost', 'St Clare taking the Veil', 'St Francis handing back his clothes to his father'. At top right is the Prophet Isaiah.",
    "images/POTTER, Paulus/The Young Bull.jpg": "Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Entry into Jerusalem (detail) (1).jpg": "The small tree, withered and leafless, that shows behind Christ's halo, is the fig-tree that Christ found without fruit. The depiction of the compact, polygonal marble building which dominates the silhouette of the city is probably based on historical or then contemporary central structures.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/Allegory of Obedience (detail).jpg": "Two young men, a monk of the order and a layman, will follow in the footsteps of the saint. An angel has already taken one of them by hand. She holds out a mirror, as a symbol of knowledge, towards the kneeling monk, whom the young men are following, and her astrolabe stands for the wider context which she is able to recognize.",
    "images/NICCOLÒ DI PIETRO/St Benedict and the Poisoned Wine.jpg": "In the second painting St Benedict, called to oversee a monastery without an abbot, sits down in the refectory together with two monks, dressed like him, in the black tunic and cowl that were characteristic of the monastic order he founded. Benedict blesses a cup of poisoned wine held out to him by an elegantly dressed layman, who is also wearing a curious green hat. The full table and the page's elegant clothing may allude to the monks' relaxed customs before Benedict's arrival, who has since restored the strict rules of the order, leading the monks to make an attempt on his life.",
    "images/PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista/Peasant Girl.jpg": "Only a partial view of the boy is given, and his face, which is aligned slightly rearwards, is partly covered by a large hat. In his frontal view of the sleeping girl, the artist underlined the intimate, lascivious character of the picture by giving her a low-cut dress.",
    "images/AACHEN, Hans von/Allegory of Peace, Art and Abundance.jpg": "The three female figures embody Peace (with an olive branch), Science and the Liberal Arts (with a sphere and a palette) and Abundance (with a goblet and a horn of plenty). The subject was intended to symbolically extols the Emperor's peaceful policies that led to prosperity and the flourishing of learning and the arts.",
    "images/SCARSELLINO/Virgin and Angels Imploring Christ not to Punish Lust, Avarice, and Pride.jpg": "The losses in the lower zone are most considerable: here the allegorical figures are shorn of their lower parts, and the landscape with a tower construction in the background seems brusquely interrupted. In the painting, Christ appears among the clouds in the act of hurling punitive bolts of lightning on three figures of women who cling to each other fearfully below. They represent allegories of Lust (the young, partially nude figure to the left), Avarice (the elderly woman clinging possessively to her bag in the centre), and Pride (the woman clad in showy dress, jewels, and feathered headdress to the right). The Virgin, kneeling at Christ's feet, implores pity for the sinners. The surrounding angels echo her plea.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Portrait of Dr. Johannes Cuspinian (detail) (2).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the background at right. The nine women appear to be the nine Muses, who were answerable, according to Greek myth, to their leader Apollo, who has been identified as the figure behind the tree at the left of the picture. A balance is intended here to the fire behind Anna Cuspinian.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/View of Delft (1).jpg": "Signature: Signed with monogram, below left on the boat. We admire the town, but it is not a profile view of a township, but a painting, an idealized representation of Delft, with its main characteristics simplified and then cast into the framework of a harbour mirroring selected reflections in the water, and a rich, full sky with magnificent cloud formations looming over it.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/Satyr and Girl (detail).jpg": "The expressive face of the horned satyr is powerfully modelled with complex shades of colour, the red cheeks indicating how much wine has been enjoyed.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Sforza Triptych (exterior).jpg": "The knightly St George, who is just killing the dragon, probably has a special relationship to the donor of the altarpiece, shown as a knight in armor.",
    "images/GADDI, Agnolo/Recovery of the Wood (detail).jpg": "The wood, buried earlier by Solomon, floats to the surface of a pond where many who had fallen ill sought to be cured. Jews pull the wood from the water and construct from it the True Cross.",
    "images/MURILLO, Bartolomé Esteban/The Two Trinities.jpg": "The visitor who flinches from uplifted eyes and pink-cheeked cherubs should perhaps first focus on the firm drawing of the hands, here masterfully foreshortened and individually characterised in eloquent communion. In this painting, probably commissioned as an altarpiece, Joseph - the only character directly to address us - holds the flowering rod, sign of God's will that he become Mary's husband. The Christ Child is raised on a dressed stone, both a compositional device to set him at the apex of a triangle in the centre of the painting and symbolic: 'thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion...a precious corner stone, a sure foundation' (Isaiah 28:16). As the clouds part to reveal the divine light, their shadows temper the bold red and ultramarine blue, the apricots, pinks, gold and white of the highlights to a wonderful overall harmony, a haze of grey, sky-blue and saffron.",
    "images/LEEN, Willem van/Still-Life.jpg": "This painting depicts an urn filled with flowers, grapes, peaches, plums and apricots, a pineapple and a pigeon in the foreground.",
    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/St Dominic.jpg": "Botticelli presents here the founder of the Dominican order of monks in an iconographic manner that is rarely found: above the saint, whose hand is raised in a gesture of blessing, is a half-figure of Christ surrounded by angels heralding the Last Judgment.",
    "images/LIPPI, Fra Filippo/Madonna with Child (Tarquinia Madonna).jpg": "The figures are substantial, especially the Child, whose large head, thick limbs, and heavy trunk are almost grotesque, as is the Child's inexplicable pose. The Madonna, with her nearly round head, a characteristic type for Lippi, her rigid right arm and squarish, stumpy hands with short fingers, and the ponderous, almost exaggerated draperies continue in his art. The perspective is also somewhat forced, but the sharply foreshortened upper shutter of the window is adventurous.",
    "images/TITO, Tiberio di/Prince Leopoldo de' Medici in a Cradle.jpg": "He is shown as a baby of a few months, lying in a cradle richly decorated with elaborately embroidered materials and damasks that emphasize his princely status.",
    "images/ANDRIESSEN, Jurriaan/Arcadian Landscape.jpg": "On this painting an Arcadian landscape is depicted with washerwomen on a road, a young family resting nearby.",
    "images/MOLA, Pier Francesco/Young Satyr Drinking through a Reed.jpg": "In this painting, the little satyr is shown in profile, sucking divine nectar from a low-set, open barrel, against an evening landscape.",
    "images/UGOLINO DI NERIO/Isaiah.jpg": "The prophet Isaiah is unfurling a sroll bearing the remains of an inscription from Isaiah 7:14.",
    "images/FASOLO, Giovanni Antonio/The Banquet.jpg": "The walls of the Central Hall are decorated with four scenes dedicated to villa life, separated by monochrome figures of giants standing on marble cubes. These giants support the frieze, where putti and heads of the Caesars appear. The four scenes are The Card Game and The Invitation to Dance to the right; The Concert and The Banquet to the left.",
    "images/KLIMT, Gustav/Hope, II.jpg": "A pregnant woman bows her head and closes her eyes as if praying for the safety of her child. Peeping out from behind her stomach is a death's head, a looming sign of the danger she faces. At her feet, three women with lowered heads raise their hands, presumably also in prayer - although their solemnity might also imply mourning as if they foresaw the child's fate.",
    "images/BRIL, Paul/Mountainous Landscape.jpg": "The painting depicts a mountainous landscape with wildlife around a cascade. It is an idealized view of nature, devoid of human figures or intervention:  animals including deer, rabbits, mountain goats, and a variety of birds have all gathered at the cascade.",
    "images/JANNECK, Franz Christoph/Elegant Company in a Landscape.jpg": "The painting depicts an elegant company in a landscape serenaded by musicians, a classical building beyond.",
    "images/GAUGUIN, Paul/Interior of the Artist's Home, Rue Carcel.jpg": "The solid bourgeois respectability is reflected in the cosy interior and the domestic comforts made evident in the foreground by the prominent still-life and the small work basket on the table.",
    "images/SUSTERMANS, Justus/Portrait of Vittoria della Rovere and Cosimo III as a Child.jpg": "Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere is portrayed in a an elegant black dress with a wide lace collar, with her first son Cosimo III, future Grand Duke, aged about 3 or 4 years.",
    "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Susanna in the Bath and the Stoning of the Elders.jpg": "As an exampée, this well-known biblical scene takes place in the garden of a Renaissance palace.",
    "images/ROSSELLI, Cosimo/Portrait of a Man.jpg": "The clothes of the unknown sitter - a bright red doublet lined with ermine, a linen undershirt visible at the collar, and a tall cap - indicate he was a member of the Florentine patrician class.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/St Bartholomew.jpg": "Apart from the knife, there is nothing in Rembrandt's painting to indicate that the figure is a saint; not even his clothes are obviously antique, and he grasps the knife as if he were about to cut something with it. Moreover, there is the curious accident that his short hair, parted almost in the middle, and his wide moustache give him the look of a man of the late nineteenth century.",
    "images/BOSSCHAERT, Ambrosius the Elder/Bouquet in an Arched Window (1).jpg": "The pictures frequently show blossoms which bloom at different seasons of the year, and it is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in more than one picture.",
    "images/BALDUNG GRIEN, Hans/Nativity.jpg": "An idyllic representation of the frequently painted subject from one of the most peculiar German Renaissance artists. By electing to portray the main figures simply and quietly at the back of the stable, Baldung draws the eye first to the ruined architecture and the ox and ass seen in larger scale on the left. The infant Jesus, held in his swaddling bands by putti, seems to radiate light onto Joseph's red coat and Mary's hands and face. Through the brick archway in the cracked, plastered wall, we glimpse a second miraculous vision: an angel encircled by a radiant glory is appearing to a shepherd watching his flock.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ignudo (9).jpg": "The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper left corner of the Creation of Eve (above the prophet Ezekiel). In the four ignudi of the fifth bay who hold the yellow ribbons interwoven with the bronze-coloured medallions, the use of contrapposta with a variety of gestures and poses has now been replaced the symmetrical arrangement of figures. The relationship between the figures, placed opposite each other in pairs, is based on increasingly free and complex rhythmical correspondences, with rotating movements and pronounced bendings of the limbs.",
    "images/GRÜNEWALD, Matthias/Isenheim Altarpiece (second view).jpg": "This is the second view of the altarpiece. When the wings are opened, three scenes of celebration are revealed: the Annunciation, the Angel Concert for Madonna and Child, and the Resurrection.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/Episodes from the Life of the Virgin (1).jpg": "The episodes represents the life of the Virgin from the death of Christ until her assumption in heaven. The picture shows the scenes on the right wall of the presbytery.",
    "images/HOOGSTRATEN, Samuel van/Portrait of Johan Cornelisz. Vijgeboom and His Wife.jpg": "It depicts Vijgeboom handing his wife, Anneken Joosten Boogaert a tulip in the garden of their manor house near Dubbeldam (the vicinity of Dordrecht).",
    "images/MASTER of Female Half-lengths/Mary Magdalene Holding the Unguent Jar.jpg": "Here the figure lifts the lid of an unguent jar that identifies her as Mary Magdalene, the most prominent of Christ's female followers. Her magnificent, richly ornamented clothing and headdress are typical of sixteenth-century courtly dress.",
    "images/PIERO DI COSIMO/St Mary Magdalene.jpg": "St Mary Magdalene is identified by her profile and the halo, her long hair and jar of ointment. The jar alludes to the visit of the Magdalene and the pious women to the sepulcher on Easter morning. Having reached the place where the body of Jesus would be embalmed with perfumed oils, they found the sepulcher empty and were the first to bear witness to the Resurrection. The long hair with which the Magdalene is generally depicted actually derives from an erroneous interpretation of the Gospel, arising from a confusion between the Magdalene with the nameless prostitute who, repenting of her sins, shed tears on Jesus's feet and dried them with her own hair.",
    "images/GIULIO ROMANO/View of the Sala di Troia.jpg": "The battle itself rages across the ceiling: desperate horses and warriors lie on their backs while victorious heroes stand over them. The scene is painted as a continuum interrupted only by trees painted to conceal the angular corners of the room. The paintings on the walls narrate individual stories from the war, and they are isolated in giant fictive frames.",
    "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Tobias and the Angel with St Leonard and Donor.jpg": "Tobias holds the hand of the Archangel Raphael at the right with the donor, richly dressed in a red cloak with fur trim, and his namesaint Leonard at the left. Tobias's little dog looks out at the viewer and wags his tail to add a sense of delightful immediacy to the work. St Leonard holds his attribute of prison fetters on top of a book rested on the arm of Tobias. The four youthful figures are set before an empty landscape and a uniform blue sky surmounted by a small, blessing Christ in Glory holding a Cross.",
    "images/NARDO DI CIONE/Last Judgment (detail of the damned).jpg": "To the right of the window are the damned, lined up closely and stacked in ranks, the figures' scale increasing as they are set higher up the wall. People of assorted rank are crowded together, their differences being indicated by a variety of physical types, garments, insignia, headgear, and hair and beard styles. The side of the damned has no shortage of outlandish and exotic costumes, which serve to identify the pagan rulers and authors clearly. Many turn to one another, seemingly engaged in conversation, others express their desperation with gestures of lament.",

    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Deposition from the Cross (detail) (5).jpg": "Kneeling in the foreground of the picture is a Beato. He echoes the Magdalen in his position, pose and red gown. A foreshortened arm extends out towards the viewer, drawing us into the scene before us. Behind him are five men, standing further forward in the picture plane than the women on the other side whom they balance. Like the women each is contemplative, reticent and mournful. One displays to the others some of the instruments of crucifixion: three gruesomely large nails with heavy drips of blood on them, and the neatly woven circlet of thorns whose perforations can be seen on Christ's brow. Beneath their feet, indicative of Angelico's enjoyment of the portrayal of nature, is the richly leafed and flowered turf which is common to so many of his paintings.",
    "images/EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTER, Italian/The Good Shepherd (1).jpg": "There is also the \"Greek Chapel\", a square chamber with an arch which contains 3rd century frescoes interpreting Old and New Testaments scenes. Above the apse, there is a representation of the Last Judgment. Near this figure, the Madonna and the Child and the Prophet Isaiah are represented. In the Cubiculum of the Velatio (Cappella della Velata) Christ as the Good Shepherd is depicted on the ceiling, directly above the scenes from the Christian woman's life. In this fresco, the young Christ is holding a lamb over his shoulders, which was seen in some Roman art hundreds of years before. Christ is very simple, he does not have a beard or elegant clothing. He also lacks a halo, which emphasizes the humility and simplicity of the early Christian art.",
    "images/DOMENICO DI BARTOLO/View of the Pellegrinaio (2).jpg": "This picture presents a view of the Pellegrinaio, seen from the north (entry) wall. On the left the east wall can be seen. The first compartment in the picture (the 2nd bay on the east wall) shows the Vision of St Sorore by Vecchietta.",
    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/The Finding of Moses.jpg": "The baby on whom Pharaoh's daughter has taken pity resembles the Christ Child blessing the Magi or the shepherds in a scene of the Adoration. In the background on the left an Egyptian priest worships the dog-shaped god Anubis (barely visible now that the surface paint has grown thin and transparent). We know we are in Egypt because on the rock above the main scene a river god, symbolising the Nile, embraces a sphinx, palm trees stand on the shore and an obelisk rises up behind a stately temple. Each plays her role in the dramatic tale, the princess generous and commanding, the maids curious and delighted. The humbler figure in a white shift at Moses' head may be his sister who watched from nearby to see what would happen to him, and recommended their mother to Pharaoh's daughter as a wet nurse.",
    "images/SPINELLO ARETINO/St Nemesius and St John the Baptist.jpg": "St John the Baptist is readily recognizable by the camel hair cloak, by the bare feet, the unfolded parchment scroll. St Nemesius, the Roman tribune, is dressed by Spinello Aretino in the garb of a contemporary knight.",

    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Rehoboam - Abijah (detail) (1).jpg": "The young man at right is seated bent forward in an attitude of complete abandon. His head, with his face turned toward the wall, is resting on the hand placed on his right knee; his other arm hangs down at his side. Behind him, a young boy seems to be trying to make him sit upright by grabbing his shoulder. The juxtapositions of bright colours in the woman's clothes - a green scarf over her head and shoulders, a violet-rose pinafore, a reddish-orange mantle with yellow ocher lining - are matched by equally rich, but more delicate, tones in those of the young man.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Ancestors of Christ figures (detail) (3).jpg": "The figures are in the triangular spandrel in the eighth bay between the Libyan Sibyl and Daniel. The spandrel is above the Jesse-David-Solomon lunette. The absolute immobility of the enigmatic figure depicted frontally provides a triking contrast to the activity of the woman in the opposite spandrel. Placed precisely on the axis of the triangle, she appears to be deep in meditation and totally extraneous to the two figures - a man and a child - that may be discerned behind her in the darkness. In accordance with the lunette below, it can be assumed that Jesse as a child is depicted here together with his parents.",
    "images/BALDRIGHI, Giuseppe/The Family of Philip, Duke of Parma.jpg": "The present group portrait shows the Duke and his wife Louise Elisabeth of France with their daughter Isabella of Parma (later wife of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor), and their younger children Ferdinand, the later Ferdinand I of Parma and Maria Luisa (later Queen of Spain). The girl is keeping her brother's miniature sword away from him. Portrayed in profile on the right is the children's gouvernante, Marie Catherine de Bassecourt.",
    "images/ROBERTI, Ercole de'/Portrait of Ginevra Bentivoglio.jpg": "The subject was the wife of the tyrant of Bologna (the city walls of which may be seen in the background) and was an outstanding patroness of the arts.",
    "images/TERBORCH, Gerard/The Suitor's Visit.jpg": "In a darkened interior embellished with gilt leather walls and an ornate marble and carved wooden fireplace, a group of fashionably dressed youth are gathered. The features of the man entering at the left, the suitor, are reputedly those of Terborch's talented pupil Caspar Netscher.",
    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Austrian/Cardinal Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg.jpg": "In the background left of this portrait, the medieval residence town of Salzburg is visible in a section of a landscape: the Romanesque cathedral, the late-Gothic Church of St. Francis, the fortress and the town wall as well as the summit of the Untersberg.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/Saint Mary Magdalen.jpg": "This monumental figure is created entirely by large patches of bright colours, rather like an early 16th-century Venetian painting. Yet even with this new use of colour Piero still concentrates on the attention to detail typical of his mature works: the shining light reflections on the small bottle, the hair that is depicted strand by strand on the saint's solid shoulders.",
    "images/GRECO, El/The Holy Family (1).jpg": "Noteworthy is the figure of St John the Baptist: he turns towards the viewer and makes a gesture urging silence so that the child will not be awakened.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist (detail).jpg": "Wearing a black cap and cloak, as was suitable for a respected artist, an attractive and elegantly dressed man in his fifties as Vasari describes him, Luca Signorelli really looks like a director so pleased with himself for the success of his theatrical representation that he stands on stage for his deserved curtain call (Scarpellini).",
    "images/UDEN, Lucas van/Panoramic River Landscape.jpg": "The painting shows a panoramic river landscape with a rainbow, together with a sailing boat and shepherds resting with their herd in the foreground.",
    "images/PONTORMO, Jacopo/Deposition (1).jpg": "The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Pietà (1498). An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot. The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself.",
    "images/MOLENAER, Jan Miense/Amorous Couple in an Inn.jpg": "The panel represents an amorous couple in an inn with other figures drinking and playing cards in the background.",
    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/The Scourging of Christ.jpg": "A classicizing atmosphere is created by the relief running across the foreground, which places the scene on a stage and separates it from the spectator. Other classicizing elements are the column bearing an idol, and the simulated bas-reliefs of the background wall, which recalls the scaena of an ancient Roman theater.",
    "images/CONTE, Meiffren/Still-Life (1).jpg": "The painting depicts a still-life with silver and gold plate, shells, and a sword.",

    "images/BRUEGHEL, Pieter the Younger/The Peasants' Brawl.jpg": "This panel depicts a fight between two peasants armed with a pitchfork and a flail, and four others, including two brave women, attempting to intervene. The barrel and flagon together with the scattered playing cards clearly suggest the cause of the quarrel.",
    "images/FLINCK, Govert Teunisz/The Company of Captain Albert Bas and Lieutenant Lucas Conijn.jpg": "Twelve militiamen are depicted in this group portrait. The seated man in black is the captain, Albert Bas. It is assumed that the profile portrait in upper right represents the artist himself.",
    "images/RIBERA, Jusepe de/Mary Magdalene Penitent.jpg": "The thick squared ashlars on which the saint is leaning pay tribute to the most classical of painters from Bologna, Annibale Carracci, who used them in his Pietà, a work that was made widely accessible through prints.",
    "images/GHERARDINI, Tommaso/Wall decoration (detail).jpg": "The picture shows part of the wall decoration in the room in the southwest corner of the west wing in the Villa Poggio Imperiale. This room is fascinating for its exquisite grotesque decoration covering the full height of the walls and the greater part of the vault. Its lively, symmetrical, fragile-looking motifs include griffins, masks, baskets of fruit, animals, garlands, rosettes, and other delicate plant forms.",
    "images/HEISS, Johann/The Continence of Scipio.jpg": "The painting shows an event in the Second Punic War: after Scipio Africanus's capture of Carthago Nova, the exceptionally beautiful virgin betrothed to the Celtiberian prince Allucius, fell into the hands of the Romans. Here the young man is shown kneeling before Scipio as he reunites the couple.",
    "images/TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick/The Calling of St Matthew.jpg": "The composition has also been reversed; Christ and his follower appear to the left as dark figures in the foreground. The main accent is on the brightly illuminated group on the right. The mercenary soldier pointing to the money on the table shows a profile which marks him as a descendant of types popularized by early sixteenth century Flemish artists, and the six gesticulating hands in the centre are also a survival of an older tradition.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/The Fable of Arachne (Las Hilanderas).jpg": "They would each compete by creating a tapestry. The everyday scene in the foreground shows a plainly furnished room where women are at work spinning. Sunlight falling in from above conjures up a complex range of colours. On the left, an elderly woman is at the spinning wheel, while the young woman seated to the right is winding yarn. One of the figures of naked youths by Michelangelo on the roof of the Sistine Chapel has been identified as the model for her attitude. Three other women are bringing more wool and sorting through the remnants. There is a second room in the background, in an alcove reached by steps. It is flooded with light and contains several elegantly dressed women. The woman on the left wearing an antique helmet and with her arm raised is a figure of Athena. Opposite her - either really in the room, or part of the picture in the tapestry on the back wall? - stands the young Arachne, who has committed the sacrilegious act of comparing her skill in weaving with the goddess's. She has begun their competition with a tapestry showing one of the love affairs of Jupiter, the rape of Europa. This interpretation is still relevant if Velázquez has in fact represented the figures of Athena (now disguised, but with her shapely bare leg indicating her timeless beauty) and Arachne a second time in the figures of the old woman and the young woman in the foreground.",
    "images/KOEKKOEK, Barend Cornelis/Winter landscape.jpg": "It is cold, but the sun is trying hard to break through. Long shadows extend across the snowy landscape.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Obsequies of St Francis.jpg": "This scene is underneath the Test by Fire before the Sultan on the right wall. Grieving Franciscan brothers encircle the dead founder of their order. Some are kneeling in order to kiss the stigmata on his hands and feet. A figure dressed in red is bending over the dead body in order to examine the wound in the saint's side. To the left a priest is celebrating the funeral mass wearing a pair of spectacles on his nose - still an unusual motif, for Canon van der Paele in Jan van Eyck's Bruges Madonna of 1436 is still holding his spectacles, together with his book, in his hand. To the right is the Franciscan Order in all its simplicity, and with its kindly, somewhat rustic looking monks. The church in the background has a sober appearance, though it gives on to a Tuscan countryside lush with rivers and streams. Here too, lesser-known characters are portrayed, undoubtedly either the monks of the nearby church of Ognissanti, so dear to Domenico, or those of Santissima Trinita. The delicate touches of grey and white can only be his. His too is the light that streams over the faces, that gives a warm serenity and infinite peace to the countenance of Francis, motionless in death, and that falls on the gilded yellow of the pillow, on the reds and blues, and on the white clouds in the sky.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Haywain.jpg": "In the central panel sin is represented through the metaphor of a large wagonload of hay for which a greedy world grasps. All the while, the wagon is being pulled by demons towards the right panel - which shows one of Bosch's earliest depictions of hell.",
    "images/ROBUSTI, Marietta/Self-Portrait with Madrigal.jpg": "On this canvas the young woman is shown in three-quarter figure, in a white dress in thick pleated fabric, where the colour and lines merge with those of the music sheet she holds in one hand, while the other brushes against the keys of a harpsichord. The sidelong glance and slightly turned body seem to indicate that the portrait was painted in front of a mirror and that it is indeed a self-portrait, as generally thought.",
    "images/FERRARI, Luca/Prudence.jpg": "Interspersed with the painted scenes are depictions of the Virtues (Prudence, Nobility, Eloquence, and Kindness), set in illusionistic niches.",
    "images/RICCI, Sebastiano/Apotheosis of Hercules.jpg": "The Apotheosis of Hercules, depicted in the centre of the ceiling, was one of the most popular subjects for the decoration in baroque ballrooms. The quintessential virtuous hero represented the prototype of the mortal whose virtue and merit are rewarded by the gods with immortality.",
    "images/KESSEL, Jan van, II/Still-Life.jpg": "This painting depicts a still-life of a swan and other birds, with rabbits, fruit and vegetables and a landscape beyond.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Juan de Pareja.jpg": "In the portrait of Juan de Pareja, a wide white collar with a jagged border contrasts effectively with the black of the model's hair and beard and his copper-coloured complexion. The dark eyes glow with great expressive force.",
    "images/MASTER of the Castello della Manta/Fountain of Youth (central image).jpg": "In the centre of the window (south) wall, between the two windows, is the late Gothic fountain. To the left of it a number of travelers are shedding their clothes and stripping off their stockings. At the fountain's edge various figures are either climbing into the water themselves or being assisted by others. Inside the hexagonal basin three rejuvenated couples are engaged in erotic games. The top of the fountain is crowned by a small Cupid busily shooting his darts down among the happily rejuvenated figures disporting themselves to the right.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/Aldobrandini Madonna (Garvagh Madonna).jpg": "The background of the painting probably shows a landscape near to Rome.",
    "images/TURA, Cosmè/Allegory of July Triumph of Jupiter.jpg": "The upper scene depicts the Triumph of Jupiter as an allegory of July. To the left is a wedding, and monks at a sanctuary, to the right clerics and knight, and a young man resting can be seen. In the centre the astrological symbol Leo, below Duke Borso receives dignitaries.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Doubting St Thomas (panel 2).jpg": "The Doubting St Thomas and the episode depicting The Funeral Procession on the front side are presumably the only pictures in the crowning panels which have retained their original hexagonal form. The scene in which the doubting disciple, St Thomas, puts his fingers into Christ's side-wound in order to confirm the Saviour's identity, takes place in the same location as the preceding Appearance Behind Locked Doors. Inconsistencies in the spatial arrangement of the group of Apostles on the right make the figures appear to be hovering.",
    "images/CLAESZ., Pieter/Still-Life (2).jpg": "This painting depict a still-life of lemons and olives, pewter plates, a roemer and a façon-de-Venise wine glass on a ledge. and Floris van Schooten, with a colourful palette and a relatively high viewpoint, and comprising many objects and foodstuffs such as various kinds of fruit. The vast background is rendered in a muted yellow-green, moving from darker tones to the left to lighter ones towards the right, where there is stronger illumination.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Crucifixion (1).jpg": "The scene with the mourners is taking place only in the foreground. The sky and the figures under the Cross are all painted in dark colours. Blue and black dominate the scene; white is used to produce dramatic highlights. Titian succeeds in representing St Dominic's sorrow as he embraces the Cross almost entirely by means of the distribution of light and the broad sweeping brushstrokes. The stark placement of the three mourners in the immediate foreground, inviting us to share their suffering, makes this one of the first masterpieces of Counter-Reformation art, where narrative clarity and emotional empathy were denoted as artistic priorities. The Virgin and saints are arranged in a crescent, like the head of an anchor, at the base of the cross. On the left, the Virgin sways in solitary grief, while in the centre St Dominic, with exaggeratedly long fingers, feverishly clutches the base of the cross to draw strength. Christ, more fully illuminated than the others, is already beyond their reach, an effect Titian achieves by making him a little smaller than the rest and so creating a feeling of distance and separation. The blood which is pointedly depicted coursing along the sinews of his arms and down his side to soak into the loincloth also conforms to the taste and tenets of the Counter-Reformation.",
    "images/PRE-ROMANESQUE PAINTER, Italian/Donor figure.jpg": "Quite close to Müstair in the Venosta region of south Tyrol lies the little town of Malles with its simple little Benedictine church. On the narrow strips  of masonry between the apses there is the figure of a priest accompanied by the noble donor, who offers a model of the church to God.",
    "images/CHAMPAIGNE, Philippe de/The Échevins of the City of Paris.jpg": "The individual heads are painted with great naturalism, but the figures kneel in hieratic poses on either side of a small altar, supporting a crucifix, on the base of which is the figure of St Geneviève, the patron saint of Paris.",

    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Adoration of the Shepherds (detail) (2).jpg": "The long procession that winds along the sloping road reminds us of the one in the Adoration which Gentile da Fabriano had painted for Santissima Trinita sixty years earlier.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/The Flagellation (detail) (2).jpg": "This figure in the foreground is probably a portrait. Bearded in the Byzantine fashion, he also wears a Byzantine hat. He gazes earnestly outward, and his mouth is open in speech as he gestures to his two companions.",
    "images/STEVENS, Pieter/Mountain Valley with Inn and Castle.jpg": "In the centre of this composition, standing by a road junction, is an inn. In front of it sits a resting traveller, while on the road beside it another has set out again on his journey. Approaching the junction, where a horse-drawn cart has stopped, is a man with a peg-leg. On the right in the background, the ruins of an old castle can be seen.",
    "images/ALBANI, Francesco/The Four Elements Fire.jpg": "In the allegory of Fire, Cupids in the foreground make arrows in the forge of Vulcan, who is reclining on the left. Venus rides across the sky in her chariot and distributes burning torches to cupids. Semele lies on the right, her heart already pierced with love's arrow, and her lover Jupiter hovers in the centre, clutching thunderbolts.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Marriage of the Virgin.jpg": "In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). This picture shows the scene of the Marriage of the Virgin.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Venice, Hercules, and Ceres.jpg": "In the skilful perspective and in the limpid intensity of tone the figures stand out against the blue sky broken by white-gold clouds achieving a perfect balance in space with a rhythmic natural elegance and olimpian beauty. The figure of Venice enthroned is of particular beauty. As usual, Venice is enthroned in glory, but for once the triumphant fanfares, and even Hercules's club yield centre stage to the luxuriance of Ceres's wheat, and of her body.",
    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/Captain Robert Orme.jpg": "But the effect is splendidly dramatic and immediate: the thunderous sky and extravagant lighting, Orme's windswept hair, the highlighted despatches in his hand, his foaming steed, the red coat pushed open by the ready sword - all suggest a heroic and transient moment in the life of the young officer.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/The Four Evangelists.jpg": "Each gospel writer is shown with his attribute.",
    "images/FURINI, Francesco/View of the north wall.jpg": "The picture shows the north wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti. It shows Lorenzo de' Medici and the Accademia Platonica in Careggi (left) and Allegory of the Death of Il Magnifico (right). Lorenzo is shown at the Villa Careggi, a view of which is seen in the background, with members of the Platonic Academy founded by Marsilio Ficino. They are grouped around a seated figure of Plato. Lorenzo extends his hand to Philosophy, depicted as a female nude seen from the back.",

A large tent is visible in the background and a window covered by linen (the impannata, or cloth covering of a window, which gives the painting its name) can be seen at the extreme right.",
    "images/BAZILLE, Jean-Frédéric/Bathers (Summer Scene).jpg": "The Bathers shows a number of youths in a grove of birches, fooling about and bathing in a pool. The man leaning against the tree at left resembles a St Sebastian, the reclining youth an ancient river deity, and the helpfulness of the man at right may recall Christ helping the damned up out of purgatory.",
    "images/WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine/The Shepherds.jpg": "The painting shows rich people playing at peasantry, a practice that had been popular in France since at least the days of the early fifteenth-century Burgundian ducal court at Germolles.",

    "images/SIGNORELLI, Luca/The Elect Being Called to Paradise and The Damned Being Plunged into Hell.jpg": "The picture shows the frescoes on the altar wall of the chapel: The Elect Being Called to Paradise (left) and The Damned Being Plunged into Hell (right). In the window embrasures are angels and Sts Brizio and Constantius, while in the tondi of the side window embrasures, the archangel Michael and a demon (left) and the archangel Raphael with Tobias (right). Although each covers a half wall interrupted by an arch, the scene of the blessed being summoned to heaven is unimaginative and common-place, with its pretty musician angels and chocolate-box portrayals of the Elect. Whereas the scene of the Damned is constructed around the visionary, almost surrealistic, idea of these crowds of naked figures jostling for space along the banks of the Acheron, and the splendid group in the foreground of the devil whipping a terrified, screaming sinner (reminiscent of a Pollaiolo figure).",
    "images/RUSTICI, Giovanni Francesco/Conversion of St Paul.jpg": "The panel depicts the Conversion of the Roman citizen Saul, later St Paul. He appears as if just thrown to the ground, lying under the rear legs of the white charger at the centre. No halo is visible, but the yellow glowing light at the top centre of the painting appears to represent the impact of the divine light which struck Saul blind and made him fall from his horse while on his way with his soldiers to Damascus to persecute Christians. On the ground, Saul's helmet and a cuirass are scattered around him. In the group at the centre of the panel, Rustici has reinterpreted the main scene of Leonardo's Battle of Anghiari as a Conversion, probably with reference to Leonardo's preparatory drawings.",

    "images/GIORDANO, Luca/Battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs.jpg": "In the foreground, passions rage and threaten to spill off the canvas as the delightful natural wealth in the landscape recalls the happy celebration so rudely interrupted.",
    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/David and Uriah.jpg": "King David captivated by Uriah's wife sends him to the war. In a letter to his chieftain, which he handed to him, he orders Uriah to be sent to the most dangerous place in the battle. The bloody crimson cloak, the flashes of light on the protagonist's face and hands.",

    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Christ Crowned with Thorns.jpg": "This second composition, in turn, seems to have inspired the large, imposing Christ Crowned with Thorns in the Escorial, in which the figures have been adjusted to a circular field and placed against a gold ground. Christ sits on a ledge in the immediate foreground, and, as before, his eyes engage the viewer. A snarling rat-faced man rips off Christ's robe with a mailed fist; his smirking companion has placed one foot on the ledge in order to push the crown of thorns more tightly on his head, while a third man watches intently from behind the other two. In contrast, the two spectators on the left look on with cool detachment.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Reliquary Tabernacle.jpg": "This panel is divided into two sections: below, the Virgin Mary's obsequies are coming to an end, and above is her Assumption into heaven. In the lower register Christ has come to collect the Virgin Mary's soul, which he holds in the form of a small child.",
    "images/PAÁL, László/Morning in the Forest.jpg": "he tended to paint tracks, village streets or the fringes of peaceful forests, with lofty or crooked tree trunks bathed in gentle sunlight, the silvery green and sandy brown subtly nuanced, and highlighting afforded by a whitewashed house or the clothing of an old woman in the middle distance.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Lodovico/Christ Served by Angels in the Wilderness.jpg": "The androgynous, Corregiesque figure of Christ imbues this canvas with a compelling fusion of pietism and eroticism.",
    "images/ANDREA DA FIRENZE/Salvation of Peter (Navicella) (east vault cell).jpg": "On the east vault cell, above the Church as the Path to Salvation, the Salvation to Peter, a free copy of the famous mosaic by Giotto from the Old St. Peter's, known as the Navicella, is depicted. The apostles' ship, threatened by a storm, and Christ's rescue of Peter from drowning, stories that since early Christian times were understood as symbolic of the church, are to be viewed here with the subject of the fresco on the east wall.",
    "images/TANZIO DA VARALLO/St John the Baptist in the Desert.jpg": "He points towards the lamb, and gazes heavenwards. With his right hand, he holds the cross, symbol of his sacrifice. The opening onto the landscape on the right is also characteristic of this artist.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/Martyrdom of St Sebastian (left panel).jpg": "The picture shows the left panel of a diptych.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/The Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "Its approach is special in that it presents the scene in the sky, floating on clouds, thus placing Jesus and Mary and their surrounding entourage in an interesting perspective. The angelic choir greets the Queen of Heavens with song and dance. In the right foreground, with his back to the viewer, an angel dressed in blue plays the portative organ; his companion to the left a stringed instrument. Above, on both sides of the main group, the trumpets are raised high above the heads. Among the other instruments we can recognize a beautiful lute on the left, and a small oval-shaped violin (or mandola) on the right. The inner ring is composed of six tall, dancing angels; their flowing robes and the position of their hands indicate the direction of their movement.",
    "images/FYT, Jan/Game Piece.jpg": "The painting shows a game piece with a hare and various wild birds. A cat approaches from the right, creeping over the fallen log, his eyes on the small birds piled below him.",

    "images/GHEERAERTS, Marcus the Younger/Portrait of a Woman.jpg": "The symbolism, which is clearly of some complexity, embraces the tree, the stag, the flowers, even the birds and the sitters costume. The long-haired figure wears pearls attached to her wrist and a pendant with a miniature around her neck.",
    "images/RAFFAELLO Sanzio/La Disputa (detail) (6).jpg": "At the bottom of the painting, grouped around the altar with its monstrance, are church teachers, popes, bishops, and monks.",
    "images/TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de/Monsieur Henri Fourcade at the Opera Ball.jpg": "By contrast, the man portrayed at the Opera ball, who is standing significantly forward from the other people in the picture, stimulates the attention, interest and imagination of the viewer. The man with top hat in the background is Gabriel Tapié de Céleyran, Lautrec's cousin.",
    "images/COECKE VAN AELST, Pieter/Altarpiece of the Passion.jpg": "Installed in a shrine of the distinctive, Antwerp bell-shaped format, the wings are painted, attributed to the workshop of Pieter Coecke van Aelst, but the centre is carved. When closed, the altarpiece shows scenes from the adulthood and mission of Christ, ranging from the Baptism to the Transfiguration with scenes of miraculous healing. Inside the painted wings flank the carved scenes in a continuous Passion narrative, extending from the Arrest to the Resurrection. In the centre are densely figures carvings of the Carrying the Cross, a raised Crucifixion, and a Deposition.",

    "images/RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste/At the Theatre (La Première Sortie).jpg": "The picture shows a young girl in a theatre box.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Caritas (Charity).jpg": "The earlier clothed personification - the idealised figure of a woman - has been replaced by the picture of a young mother. She sits in blissful nakedness on a stone bench, her legs modestly crossed, with only a thin veil covering her head and shoulders. She breastfeeds her baby and allows two somewhat larger boys to cling on her.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Portrait of a Lady.jpg": "This fashionably dressed young woman represents an ideal of femininity often celebrated in Renaissance Florence. Her physical beauty would have been considered a reflection of moral virtue, as suggested by the orange blossom she holds, which symbolizes chastity.",
    "images/BOTTICINI, Francesco/Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "The saints flanking the coronation scene are Sts Augustine, Bernard, Jerome, and Julian.",

    "images/STRATHMANN, Carl/Salammbô (1).jpg": "Salammbô is a priestess and the daughter of the foremost Carthaginian general. She is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Zaïmph, prompting Salammbô to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back. The Zaïmph is an ornate bejewelled veil, the city's guardian, and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.",
    "images/FONTANA, Lavinia/Portrait of Antonietta Gonzalez.jpg": "The portrait shows a hybrid being somewhere between a doll-like figure and a hairy creature in court dress. The entire face of the 8-10-year-old child is covered by a thick growth of hair.",
    "images/ZEITBLOM, Bartholome/Double Portrait of an Engaged Couple.jpg": "Two lovers are represented in separate special planes, divided by a wall and window depicted with a primitive naturalism.",
    "images/DORIGNY, Louis/Putti at Play (1).jpg": "On the walls of the ballroom above the balcony windows, inside six elaborate faux-stucco cartouches, the artist has painted lively scenes of putti at play. In one of the scenes, the little creatures lie on their backs, intoxicated, at the foot of a vat overflowing with grapes.",
    "images/PASSEROTTI, Bartolomeo/The Fishmonger's Shop.jpg": "The fish shop is rich with the most minute naturalistic description, with the woman holing up the blowfish and with various types of sea shells on display reflecting Passerotti's interest in naturalistic study.",
    "images/BARTOLO DI FREDI/The Annunciation to Joachim.jpg": "This small panel portrays Saint Joachim in a mountainous setting. The angel Gabriel has come to bring him the news that his wife, Saint Anne, will bear a child. On the right side there are two shepherds near their flock, one of whom holds a bagpipe.",

    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Portrait of a Young Woman with a Fan.jpg": "This large Portrait of a Young Woman with a Fan is a pendant to the Portrait of a Man Rising from his Chair (Bredius 172). By spreading out the woman's hands and positioning her shoulders parallel to the picture plane, Rembrandt introduces that element of pictorial surprise which is so characteristic of him. The companion portrait of the woman's husband, now in Cincinnati, which shows him rising from his chair and extending his hand in a gesture of welcome, is even more startling.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/9. Exaltation of the Cross (detail).jpg": "The Eastern Emperor Heraclius wages war on the Persian King and, having defeated him, returns to Jerusalem with the Holy Wood. So Heraclius, setting aside all pomp and magnificence, enters the city carrying the Cross in a gesture of humility, following Jesus Christ's example.",
    "images/MUCHA, Alphonse/The Slav Epic cycle, No. 6.jpg": "The cycle depicts the mythology and history of Czechs and other Slavic peoples. It depicts The Coronation of the Serbian Tsar Stefan Dusan as East Roman Emperor: The Slavic Code of Law.",
    "images/GUTTENBRUNN, Ludwig/Portrait of Joseph Haydn.jpg": "The portrait shows Haydn in the act of composing: he is seated at a keyboard, gazing into the distance, testing out notes with one hand and putting pen to paper with the other.",
    "images/REHBERG, Friedrich/Cain.jpg": "The composition presents the archetypal figure of the fratricide, with the weapon and the snake - the symbol of sin - at his feet. The figure is the main focus of attention, while the landscape in the background - showing his murdered brother Abel and their parents Adam and Eve - is the ideal setting for the human being, considered during Neoclassicism as the centre of the universe.",
    "images/RICHTER, Franz Ferdinand/Portrait of Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.jpg": "He is portrayed in the year of his death, with his beloved Florence - symbolized by Brunelleschi's miraculous dome - in the background.",

    "images/BAMBINI, Nicolò/Ceiling fresco (detail) (5).jpg": "Complex allegories abound on the ceiling. They appear painted in monochrome against a golden field, in medallions that crown the faux wall cornices and doors. The picture shows Nobility and the personifications of two rivers.",
    "images/LOTTO, Lorenzo/The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (1).jpg": "He is depicted in devotion in the left background.",
    "images/RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste/Dance at Bougival (detail).jpg": "The woman's face, framed by her red bonnet, is the focus of attention, both ours and her companion's.",
    "images/CHURCH, Frederic Edwin/Cross in the Wilderness.jpg": "This painting depicts a wild and desolate landscape developed around the central motif of the painting, the cross, which, though placed in a central position, is overshadowed and passes almost unnoticed among the grandeur of the natural setting.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/Flagellation.jpg": "The atmosphere is so dense that the pillar before which Christ is being whipped can hardly be made out, but the handling of paint is so fluent that the cruel action taking place has its own powerful rhythm. The viewer is caught up in the horror. The near-naked Christ is being twisted into position by the torturer on the right while the torturer on the left tears at his hair. At the bottom left a third tormentor stoops to prepare his scourge.",
    "images/GRIFFIER, Jan I/Winter.jpg": "This painting depicts a winter landscape with skaters, church and village along the banks of a river,",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Annunciation.jpg": "Tintoretto multiples the perspective details, such as the straw-bottomed chair below the angel, which emphasizes the poverty of the Virgin. In late medieval painting north of the Alps, Mary's conception is often shown as a depiction of the infant Christ flying toward the Virgin on a divine ray of light, like a naked putto. The announcement of the imminent divine maternity is given by the Angel to Mary in surroundings where everything is realistically described down to be the smallest detail: the dilapidated brick base and column; the two-coloured floor of large marble tiles; the straw-bottomed chair which clearly shows the passing of time; the work basket and its contents at the Virgin's feet; in the background the large bed covered by a canopy. No less realistic, even if in a theatrically scenographic sense, is the outside setting where Joseph is busy with his work surrounded by carpenter's tools hung outside the hut. Such objective description of the surroundings is contrasted with the visionary intensity of the miraculous apparition of the heavenly messenger and the joyful evangelical song, which break in from the left. They are preceded by the Holy Spirit in the form of a snow-white dove with unfolded wings, almost perpendicularly above the Virgin's head.",
    "images/VOSMAER, Daniel/The Harbour of Delft.jpg": "This picture presents a clearly identifiable view of delft from the south, between the Rotterdam Gate and the East Gate, where the city wall springs back. Beyond the city walls the dense roofscape of Delft is visible, dominated by the towers of the Oude Kerk, the Stadhuis (Town Hall), and the Nieuwe Kerk and by the windmill in the centre.",
    "images/GIULIO ROMANO/View of the Sala dei Giganti (west wall).jpg": "On this wall one sees the first moment of the collapse of the right wall. In the corners on the left and right the giants are heaving up boulders, as if they were trying to build a vault over the room. But the view into the open landscape between them reveals in the distance, beyond the river, the destruction of the first group of giants. The giants fleeing from there, swimming through the water, bring the disaster into the foreground. The screaming, boulder-carrying giant on the left seems to be getting into dire straits as well.",
    "images/VERMEER, Johannes/Woman with a Lute near a Window.jpg": "The left part (from the viewer's perspective) of the lady's figure is bathed in strong light, whereas the rest falls abruptly into penumbra, in concordance with the chiaroscuro pattern derived from the master of Leyden by many of his disciples, such as Leonard Bramer. On the back wall, a large map on which the word EUROPA can be made out.",
    "images/GIOVANNI DI PAOLO/Crucifixion.jpg": "The fifth element of the predella is missing.",
    "images/YÁÑEZ DE LA ALMEDINA, Fernando/Madonna and Child with Infant St John.jpg": "This picture combines motifs from the compositions by Leonardo, notably the Madonna of the Yarnwinder, and places them against a bright landscape derived from Flemish painting, an idea found in paintings of Raphael and Fra Bartolommeo.",
    "images/BARBARI, Jacopo de'/Still-Life with Partridge and Gauntlet.jpg": "This Still-Life with Partridge, Gauntlet and Bolt of a Crossbow is the earliest independent still-life in the European painting.",
    "images/VOORHOUT, Johannes/Domestic Music Scene.jpg": "The picture shows Buxtehude playing a viol, while his friend Johann Adam Reinken (1623-1722) is at the harpsichord.",
    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg as St Jerome in a Landscape.jpg": "Two of them show the Church Father, alias Albrecht, in his study, and two in a landscape, though the latter two show him not as a penitent, but as an author, like the two indoor scenes.",
    "images/MIERIS, Frans van, the Elder/The Painter's Studio.jpg": "This is the subject of Mieris's painting depicting a black-garbed visitor who is not looking at the unfinished painting on the easel but a piece of sculpture standing on a covered table.",
    "images/FRANCESCHINI, Baldassarre/History of the Medici.jpg": "This scene depicts Crown Prince Cosimo II",
    "images/HOOCH, Pieter de/The Visit (detail).jpg": "Hints that Jan Vermeer influenced De Hooch in The Visit may be detected in the reflection of the woman's head and red jacket in the window glass to the left (which recalls the window in Vermeer's Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window) and in the highlighted red jacket itself, which together with the woman in a yellow jacket and white scarf remind one of the two figures diagonally juxtaposed in the Officer with a Laughing Girl.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Flight into Egypt (detail).jpg": "In this memorable landscape, the waves on the pond, whipped up by the breeze, sparkle; the walls of the isolated cottage shiver in golden glows; the profiles of the tree trunks and branches are lit up by bright threads of light; the crests of the hills and the outlines of the mountains loose their composure in a myriad of fragments of light.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The Fall and Expulsion from Garden of Eden (detail) (1).jpg": "The tempting serpent assumed the appearance of a woman.",
    "images/ROTTMAYR, Johann Michael/Andromeda Being Taken Up into Olympus.jpg": "The picture shows one of the ceiling frescoes in the Ladies Apartments where the paintings contain motifs related to women (Virtue, Ariadne, Andromeda).",
    "images/MANGLARD, Adrien/Coastal Landscape.jpg": "This painting, depicting a coastal landscape with a ship and figures on the shore, is a characteristic work by the French marine painter Adrien Manglard. The principal subject of his marines, and indeed of the present work, is the sea itself: the figures are marginalised, the landscape merely acts as a backdrop or framing element, and the ship being tossed on choppy seas is moved to the far left of the composition.",
    "images/CANALETTO/Old Walton Bridge.jpg": "The view Canaletto has chosen shows the river from the Middlesex, or north side, looking upstream. He has peppered the scene with naturalistic details and human incident: a storm cloud with sheeting rain effectively contrasts with the white latticed wood of the bridge, over which an impressive carriage is drawn; in the foreground the mast of a boat has been lowered so it can travel beneath its arches, and a seated artist, who must be Canaletto himself, is depicted. According to an old catalogue of the Hollis collection the three standing figures to the right of the artist are Hollis himself, his friend Thomas Brand who inherited the painting, and his Italian servant Francesco Giovannini; the little animal between them is Hollis's pet dog, Malta.",
    "images/BOUYS, André/La Récureuse.jpg": "The subject is humble enough, domestic and also notably demure in treatment. In her prettily-striped dress, the young servant girl is seriously absorbed by her task of polishing the scattered silverware, itself painted with serious, absorbing attention to shape as well as to surface.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (detail) (1).jpg": "This detail of the central panel shows the Virgin Mary, St John and the rood screen altar. The rood screen divides the nave from the liturgical choir of a church, to which only the clerics had access. A priest is celebrating mass at the richly furnished altar; he has just raised the host, performing the rite known as the elevation which immediately precedes the consecration, when the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. The retable of the altar here consists of a gilded shrine with carved figures, on which (as very often in the Netherlands) a shrine with the figure of the Virgin and with painted doors is placed.",
    "images/VERROCCHIO, Andrea del/Madonna with Sts John the Baptist and Donatus.jpg": "The composition consists of three spatial tiers, beginning with the plane close to the spectator where the saints are seen standing, proceeding through an elaborate throne in which the Virgin and the infant are seated in mid-ground, and ending with a rich view of mountains, forests and winding paths at the back. St Donatus, on the right, gazes at St John the Baptist, on the left, who looks at us while pointing his finger at the Christ Child. The seated mother and infant draw our attention back to the standing saints. Whereas the Virgin's legs project towards St Donatus, her face turns to St John the Baptist, who appears to gain more prominence as the infant's blessing is directed at him as well. The severe lines that define the architecture in horizontal and vertical parallels contrast with the undulating lines that separate the landscape from the sky. Likewise, the harsh and angular surface of the marble is juxtaposed with the soft texture and round shapes of the leaves and flowers. While appearing a bit austere, Verrocchio incorporated the motifs that had modern appeal: the most recent architecture, still-life elements, a carefully modulated tile floor, and the beautiful oriental carpet down below with the fringes hanging over the last step.",
    "images/ROBERTI, Ercole de'/Griffoni Polyptych Predella (left view).jpg": "The predella of the Griffoni Polyptych shows the miracles of the saint as successive scenes in a long line.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The Deluge.jpg": "The eighth scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Deluge, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the second bay, between the triangular spandrels. In fact, in the foreground of the fresco, the latter seek to flee from the threat of the rising waters by crowding onto the rocky islet on the right or by wearily climbing up to the high ground on the left. In the distance, the wicked, having reached the platform surrounding the Ark, hurl themselves against the vessel from which they have been excluded. Lastly, those who have reached a boat that is about to capsize, between the Ark and the hill in the foreground, are also engaged in a fierce struggle. The large field, with the Deluge, is divided into several sections with some wonderful details, but these are not properly integrated. One has to compensate by looking at the groups of figures reminiscent of antiquity yet full of new experiments and of movement; of naked human beings toiling, carrying or being borne away and resigned to their inevitable fates.",
    "images/LANFRANCO, Giovanni/Venus Playing the Harp (Allegory of Music).jpg": "The elaborate harp depicted is based on an actual instrument: previously in the Barberini collection it can now be seen in Rome's Musical Instruments Museum (Museo degli Strumenti Musicali).",
    "images/MASTER of Saint Nicholas/The Resurrection of Drusiana.jpg": "The work presents the distinctive traits of the Master of Saint Nicholas: the hands of the characters appear in different positions and even point to the central motif with a fore-finger; their faces are depicted from the front and reveal narrow chins, well-defined bone structures, clear complexions and peculiar almond-shaped eyes, with eyelids that droop a little and foreheads slightly knitted.",
    "images/GIORGIONE/Self-Portrait as David.jpg": "The still youthful man is wearing his hair shoulder-length. His chin is raised in truculent manner, his mouth energetically shut. We are met by a melancholy gaze emanating from softly shadowed eye-orbits and lightly reddened lids, its intensity stressed by the wrinkles of rage above the root of the nose. While the man's gaze is challenging, he turns his right shoulder towards us. Predominantly dark, the space into which hair, throat and chest disappear almost uncontoured does include a few bright spots, but these are very specific: the emotional focus of the duskily modelled face and, above the transitional beige and green of the garment, a brightly shining piece of metal on the shoulder. This man, then, is wearing martial armour. Originally, the sitter was holding the severed head of Goliath out in front of him on the balustrade that framed the picture at the bottom, adopted in other words the role of the biblical hero David.",
    "images/DANDINI, Pietro/Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.jpg": "The subject of this painting is either Esther and Ahasuerus or Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.",
    "images/FRAGONARD, Jean-Honoré/A Game of Horse and Rider.jpg": "They are equal in size and have similar colour schemes and compositions, and their subjects are complementary; each focuses on richly verdant gardens in which groups of figures have gathered to enjoy games in the outdoors. In Horse and Rider, the players have divided into two teams, one acting as a multilegged \"horse,\" bracing itself against a tree; the second team consists of \"riders\" who run and leap, one by one, onto the back of the \"horse.\" Once they are all aboard, the horse team tries to shake them off. The game is played in a garden which is natural, with no signs of human manipulation; its principal motif is a gnarled and twisted tree.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) (21).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the right wing which represents the bird-headed monster. The bird-headed monster at lower right gobbles up the damned souls only to defecate them into a transparent chamber pot from which they plunge into a pit below. The slothful man is visited in his bed by demons, and the glutton is forced to disgorge his food, while the proud lady is compelled to admire her charms reflected in the backside of a devil.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Triptych of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt.jpg": "The central panel depicts the Rest on the Flight into Egypt, while the left and right wings represent St John the Baptist and St Mary Magdalen, respectively.",

    "images/TERBORCH, Gerard/The Van Moerkerken Family.jpg": "The watch held by the head of the family can be interpreted as a vanitas motif (a reminder of mortality) or as a symbol of temperance.",
    "images/SANTERRE, Jean-Baptiste/Portrait of an Artist.jpg": "The painting shows a portrait of an unidentified artist holding a palette and brush before an easel.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Hunters in the Snow (detail) (1).jpg": "Our eye roams from a high vantage point over an extensive, diverse landscape that develops from the cultivated foreground area to an ever wilder nature in the distance.",
    "images/CÉZANNE, Paul/The Card Players.jpg": "Here the background is mainly dark, and only a few light-coloured strips give an idea of space, perhaps the roofed terrace of a café. The scene is lit by artificial light, which is reflected on the table-cloth, bottle and pipe.",
    "images/CASTILLO, Antonio del/St Acisclus.jpg": "The present almost sculptural depiction of one of the patron saints of Córdoba shows St Acisclus holding a sword and a martyr's palm.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Last Judgment (detail) (21).jpg": "The detail shows a group of the damned being sucked down into hell. The judgment passed on them is represented by the figure in the centre who seems to be suffering an inner torment, similar to that of the artist himself: despair, remorse, and the fear of physical and spiritual annihilation.",
    "images/EYCK, Jan van/The Ghent Altarpiece Singing Angels (detail) (2).jpg": "In the upper part of the polyptych there are two pictures depicting angels singing and playing music. Their ornamental clothes, painted with painstaking detail, and their natural appearence increase the power of this tremendous vision.",
    "images/PÉREZ, Bartolomé/Basket of Flowers.jpg": "Such images of flowers casually arranged and filling an open weave basket differ from the formal presentations of bouquets in vases and were perhaps intended to be seen as recently-gathered fresh flowers on short stems.",
    "images/LANFRANCO, Giovanni/Nave vault.jpg": "It is centred on the Ascension of Christ which is distributed across three panels treated as glimpses into heaven: a choir of angels, the ascending Christ, and God the Father. The continuous blue background suggests a unified space extending above massive, three-dimensional framing of the ribs. The three-part centre sequence is framed by seven vault caps in which numerous Old Testament can be seen in loose groupings, some lounging on clouds, some seated on the painted frames or cut off by them. He represents Abel (at the bottom of the present photo), who as the first murdered human was also the first to glimpse the glory of Paradise.",
    "images/MARATTI, Carlo/Apollo Chasing Daphne.jpg": "Maratti depicts the point at which Apollo almost catches up Daphne and she is rescued by changing into an olive tree. In the foreground lies Peneus, recognisable as river god by his crock of flowing water. His Apollo follows the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican. The nymph to Apianus' right strongly resembles a print by Marcantonio Raimondi based on Raphael.",
    "images/PINTURICCHIO/The Annunciation (detail) (3).jpg": "What first catches the eye is the shelf just above it, on which books and other objects are arranged in the manner of a still-life. One of the books lies open. The white cloth draped decoratively across the front of the shelf casts a strong shadow on the wall, as do the candle and the wine carafe. These shadows presuppose some source of light from above and to the left, as do those of the two foreground figures.",
    "images/JACOPO DI CIONE/San Pier Maggiore Altarpiece Adoring Saints (detail) (3).jpg": "The picture shows the head of St Lawrence.",
    "images/GHERARDI, Filippo/Vault decoration.jpg": "The picture shows vault border scenes (trophies, weapons, armour, standards, and groups of Oriental figures) in the Grande Galleria in the Palazzo Colonna. They are part of the splendidly colourful decoration of the gallery, in which heraldic, ornamental, and figural motifs combine to create a dizzying spectacle.",
    "images/VASARI, Giorgio/Portrait of Lorenzo the Magnificent.jpg": "Lorenzo is depicted wearing the clothes he wore at home but the fur lining on his sleeves is an indication of the subject's high social standing. He is leaning on a marble pillar decorated with a mask in relief. An ancient-style oil lamp, consisting of a porphyry base topped by a bizarre mask, sits on top of the pillar. On the right, there is another marble base, on which we read \"Virtue triumphs over vices\".

    "images/HONTHORST, Gerrit van/The Mocking of Christ.jpg": "Since some of the same expressive devices are found in both pictures - for example , the way in which the extended hand of the standing mocker holding a candle casts its shadow on his face - both were likely to have been executed relatively close in time.",

    "images/REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn/Old Rabbi.jpg": "In his dark, simple landscapes the emphasis may fall on a windmill, the ruins of a castle, a few trees, and in the paintings with Old Testament themes, on ancient prophets, or Biblical heroines, men at war with the divine commandments, or with themselves, or with their fate. He painted the faces of eternal human tragedy: the return of the Prodigal Son, Bathsheba surrendering to her inevitable fate, Saul moved by David's psalms, and the figure of Danaë offering herself to the shower of gold. The enfeebled rabbi is sitting among his books, hands clasped, gazing into space.",
    "images/LIPPO DI BENIVIENI/Virgin and Child.jpg": "Both men are dressed in ecclesiastical robes and were therefore members of the secular Church. The different style of the tiaras they wear identify the saint on the right as a pope and the one on the left, who is also holding a book and a crozier, as a bishop.",

    "images/RÉGNIER, Nicolas/Cardsharps and Fortune Teller.jpg": "In a dark Roman inn, evoked by the ancient slab of stone, a sinister group of low-life types - a soldier, a muffled thief, courtesans, gypsies who seem to symbolize the perils of the world and the flesh - fleece two fashionable gulls. One falls prey to gypsies, while a young courtesan peers at the cards of his companion, signaling to a soldier accomplice, who has a card hidden in his palm.",

    "images/AMIGONI, Jacopo/Venus and Adonis.jpg": "Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Adonis, arrow (spear in other versions) in hand and hunting dog (or dogs) straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.",

    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/7. Finding and Recognition of the True Cross.jpg": "The artist depicts on the left the discovery of the three crosses in a ploughed field, outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem, while on the right, taking place in a street in the city, is the Recognition of the True Cross. The scene on the left is portrayed as a scene of work in the fields, and his interpretation of man's labours as act of epic heroism is further emphasized by the figures' solemn gestures, immobilized in their ritual toil. At the end of the hills, bathed in a soft afternoon light, Piero has depicted the city of Jerusalem. It is in fact one of the most unforgettable views of Arezzo, enclosed by its walls, and embellished by its varied coloured buildings, from stone grey to brick red. To the right, below the temple to Minerva, whose façade in marble of various colours is so similar to buildings designed by Alberti, Empress Helena and her retinue stand around the stretcher where the dead youth lies; suddenly, touched by the Holy Wood, he is resurrected. The sloping Cross, the foreshortened bust of the youth with his barely visible profile, the semi-circle created by the Helena's ladies-in-waiting, and even the shadows projecting on the ground - every single element is carefully studied in order to build a depth of space which, never before in the history of painting, had been rendered with such strict three-dimensionality.",
    "images/CORNELISZ VAN OOSTSANEN, Jacob/Self-Portrait.jpg": "There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Portrait of a Man with an Arrow.jpg": "The outline of this portrait is unclear due to the severe darkening of the background, which was originally a bright blue-green in colour. The man wears a black bonnet with a decorative pin in its upturned brim, depicting a Virgin on a crescent moon. His right hand rests on the edge of the painting on the far left. He holds an arrow between his thumb and forefinger, which is probably intended as a reference to his office or rank in an archers' guild.",

The latter breaks in from the right in a bright reddish halo and his brightness creates reflections on the leaves of the shrubs. The same source of supernatural light highlights the two apostles fast asleep, the third only just awoken and the row of armed soldiers which can be glimpsed on the left.",

    "images/FANTIN-LATOUR, Henri/Self-Portrait.jpg": "This self-portrait, painted when the artist was twenty-two, shows him in unkempt garb, his hair ungroomed, a character straight out of Henri Murger' Scènes de la Vie Bohème (1847).",

    "images/JACOMETTO VENEZIANO/Portrait of a Young Man.jpg": "The present portrait shows a youth bust-length and in three-quarter view, his eyes gazing off to the left. He is clad in black and is set against a dark background. A distinctive feature is the arrangement of his hair.",
    "images/GÜNTHER, Matthäus/The Apotheosis of St Benedict.jpg": "The detail from the overall painting which shows the Holy Trinity in the centre, presents the founders of the Benedictine order on concentrically aligned banks of clouds, with the angles bearing the symbols of his life - chastity, continence, survived assassination attempt (the poisoned chalice alludes to this) and the rules of the order.",

    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Madonna and Child.jpg": "Though Fra Angelico has adopted the fourteenth-century devotional formula for his Madonna, with Mary seated close to the ground, he cannot help investing her with a richly tasseled pillow and a lavishly brocaded cloth of honour. Sts Dominic and Peter Martyr are tucked in at the left and right.",

    "images/FRANCIA, Francesco/St Francis.jpg": "Francis of Assisi is gently holding a small processional cross, an item often linked to private worship. His hands are on show, with marks of the stigmata miraculously received during a mystic vision. The scene takes place in a small, private setting, open onto a quiet country scene. The saint has a young, well-characterised face that would seem to be the portrait of a man dressed as St Francis.",

    "images/ROMANESQUE PAINTER, French/Majestas Domini and Heavenly Jerusalem.jpg": "In the small apse niche one can see a depiction of Christ in his glory, surrounded by angels and the symbols of the Evangelists. The picture in the vault of the Chapelle Conventuelle shows the mandorla depicting Christ enthroned on a bench covered with cushions and with his arms raised in blessing. Above the crown on Christ's head the Holy Lamb is placed rather awkwardly upside down as it belongs to another section of the vault.",
    "images/MONET, Claude/Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies.jpg": "The vertical format of the picture, unusual in this series, gives prominence to the water lilies and their reflections on the pond.",
    "images/NOGARI, Giuseppe/Peter the Apostle.jpg": "His right hand points to the Bible, while his gaze is directed in the diametrically opposite direction to the light entering from the upper left, which embodies the source of divine inspiration. The apostle holds a key of bronze and one of gold, thus underlining his authority as the 'rock' upon which Christ will build his church (Matthew XVI, 18). Nogari emphasises the apostle's age in his picture, skilfully revealing his elderly body. Peter's right shoulder, his face, worked in thick paint, and his wispy grey hair are placed most fully in the light and stand out boldly from the dark, diffuse background.",
    "images/GALLEN-KALLELA, Akseli/Lemminkäinen's Mother.jpg": "The model in this emotionally highly charged picture, with its reductive stylisation and large areas of flat colour, was the artist's own mother. In the story, warrior and womaniser Lemminkäinen dies because he has tried to kill the swan of Tuonela. His mother rakes the pieces of his son's body from the river and puts them back together. In this picture, she tries to revive him and receives a glimmer of hope in the form of the rays of sunlight that penetrate the gloom of Tuonela. A bee brings the balm of life from the abode of the gods, and a miracle happens: Lemminkäinen opens his eyes and is once again alive.",
    "images/SKOVGAARD, Peter Christian/A Beech Wood in May near Iselingen Manor, Zealand.jpg": "In the foreground the artist minutely presents the flora found in beech forest floors, the national biotope - and the central element of the picture is the young descendent of the manor, wearing a red-white dress as a colouristic accent against all the greens.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, German/Christ Blessing, Surrounded by a Donor Family (central panel, detail) (1).jpg": "The city depicted in Christ's orb is Hamburg, shown in a topographically accurate view from the east. This view shows six churches appearing from left to right: (1) Sankt Katharinen, (2) Sankt Nikolai, (3) the Cathedral, (4) Sankt Jacobi, (5) Sankt Petri, and (6) Sankt Johannis.",
    "images/RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van/The Cloister.jpg": "The painting unites a number of painterly and compositional elements that clearly relate directly to Ruisdael's impressions from his journey: the open, generously composed riverscape contains a number of 'non-Dutch' motifs, such as a cloister complex with a ruined tower on the riverbank, the dark, overgrown hill ridge in the background, and the bizarrely shaped, knotty trunks of the ancient trees on the right-hand side of the picture. The pale bark of the dead tree on the right-hand riverbank corresponds to the ochre façade of the ruins, warmly lit by the evening sun. Dark, heavy clouds gather over the hills against the pale evening sky, whose light is reflected by flat areas of the riverbank.",
    "images/DEGAS, Edgar/Mademoiselle La La at the Cirque Fernando.jpg": "Everything else (the trapeze, the ring, the audience) has been left out. The sheer, angular viewpoint from below is a modern variation on Baroque sotto-in-su perspective.",
    "images/SODOMA, Il/Ecce Homo.jpg": "The picture highlights the half-length figure of Christ, whose bound hands are crossed in front of his naked breast. Two figures emerges from the dark background: the man on the left seems to be a Roman soldier. The man on the right is of mature age, wearing a turban, and he seems to touch the shoulder of Christ from behind.",
    "images/RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van/Low Waterfall in a Hilly Landscape.jpg": "The picture shows a low waterfall in a hilly landscape with a thatched cottage.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Linaioli Tabernacle (shutters open).jpg": "The doors of the triptych open to reveal the Virgin and Child Enthroned with St John the Baptist and St Mark. St John the Baptist is shown with his right arm curved round and up across his chest and left shoulder, and the top of his cross pushed back away from the viewer. The right foot is to the fore. The extended hand of St Mark on the Virgin's right draws the eye into the space occupied by the figure. The central panel of The Virgin and Child differs from its predecessors in Angelico's oeuvre in the absence of a circle of space-defining angels. Greater realism is achieved by translating part of the traditional gold background into elaborate golden curtains which frame the Virgin, the outline thus created echoing a pointed arch. The Child is clothed and stands upright holding His arms out in blessing.",
    "images/LOTZ, Károly/Twilight.jpg": "The setting sun hidden behind a cloud lights up the landscape of the plain, catching the shepherd and his herd in the foreground and the gleaming surface of the water. The bucolic atmosphere of landscape, the little cottage in the trees in the background and the silence of Nature preparing for rest give great intimacy to this painting by Lotz.",
    "images/DÜRER, Albrecht/The Virgin Mary in Prayer.jpg": "This painting depicts a monumental figure in a tightly cropped space, broad areas of bold colour, and highly refined enamel like treatment  of the skin surfaces.",

    "images/UNKNOWN MASTER, Italian/View of the ground floor hall (2).jpg": "Both the short and the long walls of the ground floor hall are transformed by painted decor above the wainscoting into open loggias. The window-like openings, interrupted by draperies of painted brocade, are flanked by graceful marble and crystal columns. They look out onto landscapes of a Netherlandish character, which are enlivened by figures in various activities, notably hunting. The coat of arms of Giorgio de Challant, crowned by a cross and flanked by a rampant griffon and lion, appear above the fireplace.",
    "images/GUERCINO/The Penitent Magdalen.jpg": "The five pictures in the series are all vertical and of very similar dimensions, they include representations of Sts Francis, Jerome, James the Greater, and John the Baptist.",
    "images/BRUYN, Barthel the Elder/Portrait of a Noblewoman.jpg": "Elegantly dressed and decorously posed, the subject betrays a hint of social pride that tempers domestic moderation with the mindfulness of wealth.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Maestà (detail) (7).jpg": "The detail shows St Savino, one of the patron saints of Siena.",
    "images/KESSEL, Jan van, I/Still-Life (2).jpg": "The painting depicts a still-life of peaches, plums, grapes and a lemon, with a crab, a lobster, and a glass roemer, on a partly draped table.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Christ Mocked (Crowning with Thorns).jpg": "The large, firmly modelled figures are composed against the plain, grey-blue background with the utmost simplicity, the white-robed Christ surrounded by his four tormentors. One soldier holds a crown of thorns above his head, another tugs at his robe, and a third touches his hand with a mocking gesture.",
    "images/RICHTER, Adrian Ludwig/Crossing the Elbe at Aussig.jpg": "In his picture, Richter attempts to catch the simple, moving tone of a folksong, in order to lend resonance to the venerable idea of a \"ship of life\" in which all ages of man, from infancy to old age, are united, The young vagabond gazing up towards the castle ruins becomes a personification of Romantic yearning - depicted from behind to encourage us as viewers to identify with him - while the old singer invokes bygone times. The boat itself appears much too small to carry the people crowded into it, and seems immobilized in the middle of the river.",
    "images/MASSYS, Quentin/Virgin and Child with Sts Elizabeth and John the Baptist.jpg": "This scene is at once a representation of mothers tenderly interacting with their children and an allusion to St John's martyrdom by decapitation. The atmospheric landscape sets the biblical figures not in the Holy Land, but in sixteenth-century Flanders.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Birth of St John the Baptist.jpg": "In this picture he makes use of contrasting complementary colours by placing the red bedspread in front of the green wall hanging. In front of the wall hanging, a maid dressed in red and green is carrying a tray with carafes of water and wine for the refreshment of the woman in childbed. The golden orange hues of the pilasters and entablatures form a complementary contrast with the light blue of aged Elizabeth and the young maid coming in from at the far right. She corresponds to the nurse on the far left, who is stretching out her arms eagerly. The two figures form an exciting frame for the quiet scene taking place in-between. In the Birth of John the Baptist, Elizabeth is visited by female representatives of the donor family - as is Anne in the birth scene on the opposite wall. In addition to the marvelous basket of fruit, he added another two still-lifes to the picture in order to make it appear more home-like and realistic. On the far left two objects, a brass jug and bowl, that we are already familiar with from the fresco the Last Supper in the church of Ognissanti, and from the frescoes in the Santa Fina Chapel. At the top of the bed's headboard, next to the window, there is a symmetrical arrangement of a box, two pomegranates and a vase, reminiscent of both Saint Jerome's study and the frescoes in the Saint Fina Chapel.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/Christ Carrying the Cross (detail) (5).jpg": "On the mount of Golgotha (literally, 'place of skulls') the two crosses which are to bear the bodies of the thieves have been erected and a hole is being dug for the cross which is to bear Christ's body. Onlookers on foot and on horseback flock towards this gruesome spot through a landscape dotted with gallows on which corpses still hang and wheels to which fragments of cloth and remnants of broken bodies not eaten by the ravens still cling.",
    "images/UNKNOWN ICON PAINTER, Bulgarian/The Resurrection of Christ.jpg": "The present icon represents, at the centre, Christ in glory, resplendent in a burst of golden light. He is placed within an azure mandorla, graduated in tone and hatched with golden rays. Treading upon the gates of hell, which have been thrown off their hinges and flung to the ground, Christ is flanked by two groups of personages: they are the Just of the Old Covenant, prominent among whom are the figures of King David (with the crown), Moses, and Saint John the Baptist. In the persons of Adam and Eve, rising from their tombs in the form of sarcophagi, the whole of humanity is here being won and redeemed.",
    "images/RIBERA, Jusepe de/Jacob's Dream.jpg": "Instead, the dream is suggested merely by vaporous, golden figures who might almost be part of the real sky. But the setting of the dreamer, and the play of light on his sleeping face, impart a portentous and mysterious mood to the scene.",
    "images/SANO di Pietro/Virgin and Child with Saints and Two Angels.jpg": "In the present work the Christ Child holds a goldfinch symbolizing the Resurrection, while resting his left hand on the embroidered collar of the Virgin's dress. They are accompanied by Sts Jerome, Bernardino, John the Baptist, Anthony of Padua, and two angels. The frame is carved in five sections and engaged to the panel.",
    "images/MOMPER, Joos de/Landscape with Grotto.jpg": "One of the three accessory figures is characterized as an artist, down on his knees and drawing the rocks in front of him.",
    "images/WATTEAU, Jean-Antoine/Gathering in a Park.jpg": "Watteau reveals the feeling of courtly festivals in the Feast in a Park, which is luminous and ethereal.",
    "images/LORENZO Monaco/Diptych St Jerome.jpg": "Lorenzo's St Jerome forms part of a diptych, accompanying a Madonna of Humility. The lecturn has two shelves, one holding the book to be translated, the other the translation. Jerome's red cardinal's hat can be glimpsed hanging behind the right-hand lectern. Here he had befriended a lion by removing a thorn from its paw. He is usually shown as an old man with a cardinal's hat and accompanied by his loyal and thankful lion.",
    "images/JACOPO DA EMPOLI/Pantry scene (1).jpg": "The painting shows a pantry with cask, game, meat and pottery. A clean light illuminates the game, meat, salami and on the table, a variety of foods and pottery. On the wooden instrument depicted on the far right of the canvas, it is possible to read: \"Di Jacopo da Empoli 1624\". Pantries were fitted with large wooden tables, shelves and long wooden boards over the walls, fitted with hooks for hanging foods and meats for curing. These elements can be found in the painting, but the fact that there is food on the table that has already been eaten, such as the squeezed lemon half next to an elegantly decorated pie, or the bread, broken into pieces, rather conveys the idea of a corner in a well-stocked kitchen, where the preparations are in progress for a lavish meal.",
    "images/VERONESE, Paolo/Ceiling of the Sala dell'Olimpo (1).jpg": "The ceiling shows Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Mercury and Diana, the seven gods of the sky, gathered around the figure of a woman riding a headless snake, who has been interpreted, inter alia, as an allegory of divine wisdom. The adjacent pictorial fields in the octagon illustrate the elements of fire, earth, water and air, represented by figures of the gods Vulcan, Cybele, Neptune and Juno.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Portrait of a Man (detail).jpg": "Artfully arranged on the desk before the sitter are a shaker of talc or sand for blotting the ink as he writes, a round, flat box, scissors, a small portable case for writing implements, a pile of coins, a balance with a 'dobla excelente' coin on the triangular scale and a square weight on the round scale at right, a penknife, a book with a brown leather cover closed with a stylus, and an inkstand with four writing quills, red sealing wax, and a roll of paper. The man writes on a loose quire in front of him while holding his place in his bound notebook.",
    "images/MASTER of Frankfurt/St Christopher.jpg": "Placed in a panoramic landscape St Christopher has an imposing stature and his marked features are very coarse. He is wearing a turban and a red cloak over a blue tunic. The Child appears to be firmly installed on his shoulder and the softness of his complexion contrasts with the giant's tanned skin. Finally, the hermit who told the saint of his noble vocation can be seen at the mouth of a cave. The river leads our gaze to the background where we can perceive beautiful examples of Gothic architecture.",
    "images/POZZO, Andrea/Painting on the pendentive Jael.jpg": "The monumental figures (Judith, David, Samson, Jael) have an imposing physicality, emphasized by their bright colours and strong contrasts.",

    "images/ALBEREGNO, Jacobello/Polyptych of the Apocalypse (central panel).jpg": "The picture shows the central panel of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse. In the centre of the polyptych is God the Father in Glory with the Lamb, between the symbols of the four Evangelists. In the central panel for example, where St. John the Evangelist looks up from his writing to admire the Eternal in glory with the Lamb of God, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists with wings covered with eyes, being worshipped by twenty-four venerable old men, here too the theme, though very complex, comes through with exemplary clarity because of the subtle expressiveness of the details which frees the sacred vision of every transcendent abstraction.",
    "images/GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico/Resurrection of the Boy (detail) (2).jpg": "Some monks are leaving the church's portal in a procession. It will pass along the street across the river, past the passerby, a rider and two working carpenters.",

    "images/RICHTER, Johan/The Bacino di San Marco.jpg": "The painting shows the profile of Venice as it appears from the present-day Giardini when approaching the city by boat from the Lido. To the far left is the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with the church of the same name and the complex of the Benedictine monastery. Just to the right of the island appear the Magazzini del Sal, dazzlingly illuminated, the Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute on the spit of land known as the Dorsoduro. The Campanile of San Marco looms right on the vertical axis, counterbalancing the predominant horizontals. On the right, the Riva degli Schiavoni stretches beyond the church of the Pieta. The glassy green surface of the water with the dark bank in the foreground, the contrasting light on the various buildings and the snow-white clouds lend the painting an atmosphere all its own. The boat and the shadows in the foreground are motifs which also occur in works of late seventeenth-century Dutch painters of harbour views such as Abraham and Johannes Storck, who may have served Richter as a source of inspiration. The remarkable colour combination — green and black — recalls Canaletto's work of the early 1730s.",

    "images/GUTIÉRREZ CABELLO, Francisco/Architectural Caprice with Moses Saved from the Water.jpg": "In such luxurious surroundings he sets evangelical or biblical scenes peopled by slight vivacious characters. His colouring is usually bright and vivid, his skies intensely blue. The numerous characters dressed in luxurious costumes and the circle of maidservants accompanying the Pharaoh's daughter form a colourful ensemble. Fantastic regal rowing boats sail the Nile, while carriages drawn by white horses wait on the waterfront, all of which are totally anachronistic features.",

The Theological Virtues Fides and Caritas are placed opposite each other, and serve as visual links between the ceiling and the walls.

The Vatican panel represents the encounter between the Baptist and the angel Uriel on the Mount of Penitence in Jordan (suggested by the gushing water on the right) and his immediate early vocation at the age of seven.

The girl, who wears a medallion with the profile of Cosimo around her neck, is portrayed with an expression of lucid fixity, in perfect accord with the enchanted happiness of childhood, and her very slight smile creates a magical air of suspense.

    "images/LEONARDO da Vinci/Leda (detail).jpg": "The composition of the upper part of the group is determined by a play of curves and contrasting turns, and the contrapposto motif of the standing Leda develops from this: the swan has turned his head up towards Leda, full of desire; her body is turned towards him and she is embracing him with her arm, but her head is to one side, looking at her children.",
    "images/KALF, Willem/Still-Life (2).jpg": "The backgrounds is much darker; and in this narrow space, against this background, the still-life seems curiously isolated. A soft light picks out each different object, showing its unique quality and colour, as spotlights focus on actors on a dark stage. food and utensils appear that belong to normal life: bread, beer, fish, plates and jugs of pewter or ordinary glass.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Entombment.jpg": "A strictly symmetrical group is built up from the slab of stone that juts diagonally out of the background. His figures are bowed, bent, cowering, reclining or stooped. The self confident and the statuesque have been replaced by humility and subjection.",

    "images/CHAMPAIGNE, Philippe de/Cardinal Richelieu.jpg": "The sitter for this grandiose portrait, however, is obviously not one of the artist's Jansenist patrons: where they wear sober black, he wears crimson; where they appear against a plain grey background, he stands in a palatial gallery against a great Baroque swathe of curtain, a glimpse of his château gardens behind him. Unable to have himself portrayed as ruler, Richelieu stands in the pose traditionally associated with French monarchs. Richelieu wears the chivalric Order of the Saint-Esprit, its blue moiré ribbon contrasting with the starched white linen and the crimson satin of his collar and cloak. Instead of a baton or cane, he holds a scarlet biretta in his stiffly extended right hand. Champaigne has carefully shown its inner lining catching the light, thus drawing attention to our viewpoint from below - an optical fact underscored by the low horizon line beyond. We are gazing upwards at Richelieu, his face the distant apex of an elongated pyramid down which lustrous drapery flows like lava. Although diminished in scale by the distance between us, the face is undistorted by foreshortening like the majestic images of Christ the Ruler in the apses of Byzantine churches.",

    "images/CRANACH, Lucas the Elder/Venus and Cupid (5).jpg": "Venus' white, weakly modelled body stands out against a black background in a sinuously seductive pose. The few accessories adorning the model, like the heavy red velvet hat or the precious necklace enriched with stones, are clearly added for erotic intent. The light, transparent veil attracts the viewer's attention much more than hiding any nudity. The goddess's oblique glance and almond-shaped eyes increase the equivocal nature of this image. Alongside Venus, the baby winged Cupid holds the honeycomb that he has just stolen, a source of immediate pleasure but also of pain. Behind him, the uniformity of the dark background is broken by a tree, at the base of which we find the mark of the artist's workshop, taken from the coat-of arms granted to him by the Elector of Saxony: a winged serpent with outspread wings, and the date 1531.",

In the Prado painting, there is a figure of a young, turbaned woman at right, a lady in waiting to Pharaoh's daughter. She stands next the princess and bends over the basket in which the infant Moses is being presented, her arm raised in surprise. The attendant of Pharaoh's daughter has been transformed into the figure of the Madonna, although she does wear the same exotic headdress and sumptuous scarf (as is fitting, Orazio has omitted the pendant pearl worn by the Egyptian maid to decorate her turban). The infant also switches his role to that of the Infant Christ. His position is flipped and altered, but as is so emblematic of Gentileschi's style, he rests on a brilliantly white sheet, the shadows rendered in tones of blue and grey.",

The worn leather, the ragged sole, the turned-back upper and the toe of the welt parting from the sole, are all emphatic indications of wear and tear. The shoes are seen without any illusions - a still-life of mimetic fidelity.",

The appearance of the tip of the woman's shoe peeking out from under the edge of her satin dress at the tremendous toe of the soldier's wonderful hip boot is as calculated as the colour harmony of opulent browns, reds, buff, white, and silver.",

    "images/BACKER, Jacob Adriaensz/The Tribute Money (detail).jpg": "In this scene Christ makes clear to the Pharisees that he has no interest in earthly possessions, only in heavenly riches. He points with one hand towards heaven and with the other to the coin held by the Pharisee.",
    "images/TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, Henri de/Jane Avril Dancing.jpg": "She wore a full-skirted dress of white muslin that was gathered in a narrow embroidered collar at the neck, and had wide sleeves. With this she wore a kind of beret on which a few feathers swayed.",
    "images/DECKER, Cornelis Gerritsz/Landscape with a Farmyard.jpg": "It depicts a landscape with a farmyard and figure drawing water from a well, other figures conversing nearby. A dilapidated hut with a thatched roof that leans sharply to the ground on one side stands in the middle of the present painting.",
    "images/SZÉKELY, Bertalan/King László V and Ulrik Cillei.jpg": "He presents an excellent characterization of the helpless child-king, László V (1440-1457), and his deceitful uncle, Ulrik Cillei (1406-1456) overpowers his young charge with wine, food, jesting, music and dance, and all the while the King mechanically signs the decrees and death sentences.",
    "images/DOLCI, Carlo/Guardian Angel Tutoring the Christian Child.jpg": "The angel holds a Bible and with his right hand points to a line therein. The child, his hands clasped together in prayer, looks not at the book, but at the angel, showing with his rapt expression that he has understood the message of the Scriptures.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Conversion of Saul.jpg": "Bruegel shows Paul's army on its way to Damascus in contemporary dress and with sixteenth-century armour and weapons. The saint himself is in a blue doublet and hose of the painter's day. The painter has set Saul's conversion to Paul in a mountain landscape. The sea may be seen in the distance.",
    "images/CAMPROBÍN, Pedro de/Vase of Flowers (1).jpg": "In the pair of flower pieces, now in the Prado, the bouquets are arranged in two identical gilt vases resting on a long wooden table in an unspecified interior space. Pink, white and red roses predominate in the centre of the compositions and are accompanied by irises, lilies and carnations, with generous amounts of foliage punctuating the spaces between the blooms. Flowers spill out around the vases and hang down almost to meet the loose blooms resting on the tabletop, that include a branch of lilies and a sprig of orange blossom. The finesse and attention to detail with which Camprobín depicted flowers is epitomised by the few loose leaves and fallen petals that he carefully depicted on the wooden table, motifs that also suggest that the flowers were in the fullness of their bloom.",
    "images/FRANCIA, Francesco/Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 10.jpg": "Three men hold taut a shroud supporting her lifeless body above a sarcophagus that appears to be much too small. Among the bystanders in this pastoral landscape are several sorrowing women, Pope urban, and a priest.",
    "images/BELLINI, Jacopo/Triptych of the Nativity.jpg": "Here the figures stand out clearly on the gold ground, now devoid of all transcendental significance, respecting laws of perspective and symmetry as well as of tone and colour, bathing the central panel in light.",
    "images/MOMPER, Joos de/River Landscape with Boar Hunt.jpg": "His planes are sharply separated by the standard three-colour scheme. The River Landscape with Boar Hunt is one of the most impressive examples of this early stylistic phase. This painting depicts a wide river landscape with wild boar hunting scene in the foreground. A city located on a river or lake in a valley can be seen. There are a few ships on the water, castles on the hilltops. On the right a rider passes a wooden bridge.",
    "images/CRITZ, John de, the Elder/King James I of England.jpg": "James was a strong advocate of royal absolutism, and his conflicts with an increasingly self-assertive Parliament set the stage for the rebellion against his successor, Charles I.  On the painting, the king appears full-length in a room richly decorated with an armchair with cushions on which rests his hat decorated with a jewel, identified it as \"The mirror of Great Britain\", one of the most important in this king's collection, designed to commemorate the union of the two kingdoms under his mandate. His clothes follow the European fashion of the moment, with a silver doublet with sleeves decorated with rhinestones and a leather, a kind of vest that comes from military clothing, sewn with pearls. On the shoulders wears a hoodless coat with the front edges turned lined with a rich fabric. Under the panties, the stockings and the white tights highlight his leg showing  - along with the medal of St. George that hangs from his chest - the ceremonial symbols of the Order of the Garter.",
    "images/SNYDERS, Frans/Still-Life (1).jpg": "This still-life contains fruit in a basket together with game, a bowl of fraises-de-bois, artichokes, asparagus and a squirrel upon a table draped with a red cloth.

    "images/POUSSIN, Nicolas/Winter (The Deluge).jpg": "Spring is luxuriant, Summer a fecund harvest, Autumn the gathering of mellow grapes and Winter the terrible deluge in which all mankind is overwhelmed and destroyed. Spring is cool in tone, Summer and Autumn are warm, and Winter is cold.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/Bellerophon on Pegasus (1).jpg": "The ceiling fresco is conceived as an illusionistic view of the heavens, where Bellerophon rides upon the white winged-steed Pegasus towards Glory, untroubled by the old man with the lance at the bottom of the picture, who can no longer harm him. Glory is personified by a female figure in golden yellow robes, floating on a cloud next to a pyramid, the traditional symbol of eternity.",
    "images/GIOTTO di Bondone/No. 10 Scenes from the Life of the Virgin 4.The Suitors Praying.jpg": "The men and the high priest kneel before the altar in rapt attention. They are praying for the miracle, which will decide who will marry the Virgin Mary. In front of the cupola of the apse of the church we can make out - somewhat indistinctly - the Hand of God, pointing: one of the rods will blossom.",

The left panel (probably by Lucas Cranach the Younger) represents the Baptism: Philipp Melanchthon administering the sacrament of Baptism, while the right panel (by Lucas Cranach the Younger) represents the Penance: Johannes Bugenhagen administering the power of keys by hearing confession of sins and administering absolution.

    "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": "The subject illustrates an ancient tradition, according to which Mary, being deprived of original sin, is the only one to be welcomed in heaven with the body and with the soul. In the group of the apostles, we can identify St Nicholas and St Margaret, both kneeling, in the foreground. Looking towards the public, the first one wears a pink silk cope and is accompanied by the episcopal mitre, a book and the three golden spheres of the dowry which he gave to three poor young girls (his traditional attributes); St Margaret da Cortona is portrayed as a Franciscan tertiary, with a habit and a white veil.",
    "images/NASMYTH, Alexander/View of a Lochside Castle.jpg": "The classical composition of this painting derives from the tradition of Claude Lorrain's landscapes, with the clearly defined fore, middle, and backgrounds framed by the verticals of the trees on either side.",

    "images/FOHR, Carl Philipp/Ideal Landscape near Rocca Canterana.jpg": "The composition shows a rocky pastoral landscape in the central mountains of Italy. In the foreground, a path winds past craggy rocks and old, gnarled trees. Walking along it is a festively clad country girl with a child in her arms, holding the hand of another child balancing a jug on her head. To the right, under the trees, a group of pilgrims passes into a defile, in the direction of a distant, illuminated valley. Ahead of the girl, two shepherds follow the path into the picture, where a peaceful, hilly region rimmed by steep mountains opens out. By depicting the various stages of walking and wandering, Fohr evokes the transience of all earthly things and the journey into the future, which is the true goal of human existence.",
    "images/REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua/Self-Portrait.jpg": "In this self-portrait the dramatic swath of light, rich colour, and Old Masterly stance are typical of his style.",
    "images/BRONZINO, Agnolo/Portrait of a Lady in Green.jpg": "The tilt of the head and the angle of the shoulders provide a distinctive characterisation for this unknown figure. Similar attention has been given to the costume with its slashed sleeves, puff shoulders, embroidered chemise and elegant headgear.",
    "images/DADDI, Bernardo/Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "The scene of the coronation is surrounded by eighteen angels and , behind them, fourteen saints. the first in the row of saints are St Dominic at the left, and St Francis at the right.",
    "images/RUISDAEL, Jacob Isaackszon van/View of Amsterdam.jpg": "He depicted the rather gloomy dunes and flat, green fields as well as towns, forest scenes and waterfalls; he painted a Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of a town, fishing boats at sea, tracts of marshland with trees and views of seaports, always finding the manner most suited to a particular theme, time of day, kind of weather or type of landscape. The farmsteads nestling among the trees housed Dutch peasants, on the fishing boats Dutch fishermen are seen earning their daily bread, and it is not disguised Greek deities but shepherds who are seen minding the sheep.",
    "images/PYNAS, Jan Symonsz/Aaron Changes the Water of the Nile into Blood.jpg": "This is the first plague: with his rod Moses' brother Aaron changes the water in the river into blood. In the face of Pharaoh and Moses and Aaron are due to change the water of the Nile into blood. Right to the city with a tower and a temple.",

    "images/LOTH, Johann Karl/Portrait of an Old Man with Bust.jpg": "It is hypothesized that the painting depicts the Greek sculptor and royal portraitist, Praxiteles, contemplating the bust of Alexander the Great. The elderly man with a distinctive white beard and large hands, can be identified in numerous other works by Loth, including his Mercury and Argus in the National Gallery, London.",
    "images/SODOMA, Il/Deposition from the Cross (detail).jpg": "Specifically, Vasari singled out for praise a man seen from the back but whose face is also visible in the helmet lying on the ground; with his striking parti-coloured hose, gleaming cuirass and swaggering pose he is certainly an eye-catching feature of the painting.",
    "images/GRECO, El/St. John the Baptist.jpg": "The attenuated figure, the agitated movement of the sky and the scintillating light on the landscape is characteristic of El Greco's work around 1600. The building in the landscape background was identifies as the Escorial.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/The Last Judgment (detail) (11).jpg": "St Michael, prince of the heavenly hosts is pictured as young, because he is immortal and as handsome, because he is the embodiment of divine justice.",

    "images/BOTTICELLI, Sandro/St Jerome in Penitence.jpg": "Scantily clad in a red cloak, St Jerome is kneeling as a penitent on a bare rock and is holding a stone in his hand in order to castigate himself. The book lying next to him refers to his translation of the Bible, and the red cardinal s hat hanging from a branch to his sacred office.",
    "images/DADDI, Bernardo/Madonna and Child Enthroned with Angels and Saints.jpg": "In this work note the stage-like architecture of the throne, whose almost towering cusp takes up the shape of the whole composition, and the ample yet almost weightless mass of the Virgin in the highly traditional arrangement of angels and saints that had been in vogue since the thirteenth century.",
    "images/SANDRART, Joachim von/February.jpg": "They are illustrated by life-size half figures set in landscapes or interiors and show characteristic activities associated with the respective seasons and surrounded by their natural attributes. November, under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius the hunter, shows a hunter's return. With his nervous dogs on a short leash and his catch slung over his shoulder, he is heading towards a castle in the middle distance. A keen wind tears the leaves from the trees and scatters them through the air. Landscape and genre, still-life and allegory are combined in a picture that epitomizes the month of November in concentrated form.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/An Allegory with Venus and Time.jpg": "It is designed to be seen from below, but at an angle, as we step through the door. From infinitely luminous skies, Venus, sumptuous in her white, gold and pink nudity, has swooped down in her chariot; her team of doves, released from harness flutter lovingly above her, and from a dawn-tinted cloud the Three Graces strew roses. Below, winged Cupid, her divine son, hovers with his quiverful of arrows. Venus has come to consign her newly born child, freshly washed with water from an earthenware amphora, to Father Time. Having set down his scythe, Time here signifies eternity rather than mortality. The child - wide-eyed, thick-lipped and with a precocious widow's peak in his hairline - resembles page boys frescoed by Tiepolo shortly before on the staircase of the prince-bishop's palace in Würzburg. He is clearly meant to be a real baby.",
    "images/MEMLING, Hans/Christ Giving His Blessing (1).jpg": "The dark background of this painting will also have originally been bluish-green in colour and the robe is not dark brown but red. The figure is thinner and more ascetic than the one in Pasadena. The face has the sunken cheeks of the Braque type, and the hand raised in blessing has more elongated fingers. It is positioned so that only the tip of the forefinger extends above the middle finger.",
    "images/ALSLOOT, Denis van/Skating during Carnival.jpg": "The snowy landscape, a typical Flemish genre, showed the people in their outdoor activities despite the cold. The scenes of skaters and carnivals became associated with this type of snowy landscapes. The scene depicted in his Skating during Carnival takes place in Antwerp, identified by the walls built with Charles V and the Church of St. Jacques. What we see is a social scene where the characters perform different activities, highlighting the skaters with colourful carnival costumes. The clothing of most of the characters indicates that this is the entertainment of the upper classes.",
    "images/MASTER of the Blue Jeans/A Beggar Boy with a Piece of Pie.jpg": "That the forlorn character desperately needs help is demonstrated by his poor, improvised meal as well as his curious garb, characterized by a tattered oversized jacket, ransacked from who knows where.",
    "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Market Scene (3).jpg": "Somewhere in the background, the picture - cut off at the top - affords a small glimpse of the platform where the masses are shouting 'Barabbas' (John 19:4-6).",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/Scenes from the Life of St Francis (Scene 9, north wall).jpg": "The concluding four pictures start in the third row of the right north wall. The picture shows the birth of Christ being celebrated in the monastery of Greccio. St Francis, who is kneeling in the foreground inside a church, is lovingly cradling the crib figure of the Christ Child in his arms, thus bringing it to life. The faithful who have gathered to celebrate mass notice the miracle and are gazing in reverence and astonishment at the scene. The motionless figures of the faithful and St Francis and the animals resting in the stable in Bethlehem support the static composition of the picture and give the event an air of sacred solemnity.",
    "images/HOLBEIN, Hans the Elder/Death of the Virgin (detail).jpg": "Christ himself appears in the upper, \"celestial\" sphere of the picture to receive, with appropriate solemnity, the departing soul of his mother, the small kneeling figure in a long cloak, painted with airy lightness. The garland of clouds signifies reviving heaven itself; its strong, shining colour, some rays of which penetrate through the clouds, is a reflection of heavenly glory. There are also angels on both sides of Christ to stress the importance of the event.",
    "images/CARRACCI, Lodovico/The Martyrdom of St Margaret.jpg": "The saint baring her neck for the executioner is a model of Christian virtues. These are exalted through her luminous beauty which contrasts with the brutality of the soldier to the left and the executioner himself (two figures which contain references to Titian, something so often found in Lodovico's work). The unusual foreshortening of the scaffolding, the bit of architecture that looms abruptly out of the background, and the broad opening into heaven where angels wait to receive the soul of the martyr, are quite remarkable.",
    "images/MASOLINO da Panicale/Vaulting of the Chapel (1).jpg": "The picture shows the vaulting in its state before 1987. In the spandrels of the vaulting are the four evangelists with the four Latin Church fathers. The vaulting paintings follow the pattern that had been traditional since the fourteenth century, only here each of the evangelists is paired with one of the Church fathers. They are seated together in pairs on a bank of clouds, and bathed in a yellow light. Each of the evangelists is identified by his symbol.",
    "images/GOZZOLI, Benozzo/View of the Chapel (1).jpg": "The Procession of the Magi moves towards Filippo Lippi's altar painting of the Adoration of the Child.",
    "images/TERBRUGGHEN, Hendrick/Unequal Couple.jpg": "This painting, which was altered by the artist and later cropped at the corners, depicts an almost claustrophobic interior, featuring a bare-chested prostitute clutching the fur garment of a man wearing a mask and pince-nez, both of which make him appear much older than he actually is. This churlish whore smiles at us knowingly, uncouthly exposing her discoloured teeth in the process.",
    "images/GENTILESCHI, Artemisia/Minerva.jpg": "The bronze Medusa shield in the lower right was one of her attributes.",
    "images/BRUEGEL, Pieter the Elder/The Sermon of St John the Baptist (detail) (3).jpg": "Behind St John the symbolic figure of Christ can be seen. Nobody looks at him, because he is not physically present.",
    "images/CARACCIOLO, Giovanni Battista/St Onophrius.jpg": "The monumental figure of the saint, in spite of his apparently unstable pose, is perfectly balanced in the space of the picture. Standing in the centre of the painting, Onofrius's pose is a study in contrapposto movements. The face, intense and vibrant, is rendered with rapid brushstrokes and with no attempt to hide the signs of old age.",
    "images/HALS, Dirck/Merry Company in a Garden.jpg": "In this picture the festive party, seen against a background of columns and draperies on the left, seems to be momentarily frozen into a tableau in which the participants pose to welcome a new arrival - the spectator.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Marriage Feast at Cana.jpg": "The picture is not in good condition; the upper corners have been cut off, many heads have been repainted, and a pair of dogs at the lower left may have been added as late as the eighteenth century. The marriage banquet has been placed in a richly furnished interior, most probably a tavern. The miracle of the wine jars takes place at lower right; the guests are seated around an L-shaped table dominated at one end by the figure of Christ, behind whom hangs the brocaded cloth of honour usually reserved for the bride; he is flanked by two male donors in contemporary dress. Next to the Virgin at the centre of the table appear the solemn, austerely clad bridal couple; the bridegroom must be John the Evangelist, for his face closely resembles the type which Bosch employed elsewhere for this saint. Christ and his friends are pensively absorbed in some inner vision, unaware of the evil enchantment which seems to have fallen upon the banquet hall. The other wedding guests drink or gossip, watched by the bagpiper who leers drunkenly from a platform at the upper left. On the columns flanking the rear portal, two sculptured demons have mysteriously come to life; one aims an arrow at the other who escapes by disappearing through a hole in the wall. From the left, two servants carry in a boar's head and a swan spitting fire from their mouths; an ancient emblem of Venus, the swan symbolized unchastity. This unholy revelry seems to be directed by the innkeeper or steward who stands with his baton in the rear chamber. On the sideboard next to him are displayed curiously formed vessels, some of which, like the pelican, are symbolic of Christ, while others possess less respectable connotations, such as the three naked dancers on the second shelf. The precise meaning of all these details remains unclear, as does that of the richly gowned child, his back turned to the viewer, who seems to toast the bridal couple with a chalice.",
    "images/ROMANESQUE PAINTER, Austrian/Fabulous Creatures (1).jpg": "The malicious creatures include centaurs, harpies, fish-like creatures, and dog-headed monsters devouring serpents. Armed with bow and arrow, serpent slings and clumsy bone tools, these grotesque creatures are also engaged in battle with one another.",
    "images/RUBENS, Peter Paul/The Holy Family with St Anne.jpg": "The Holy Family with St. Anne shows how tender the master's own hand could be in representing the warmth of family life.",
    "images/GOSSART, Jan/Portrait of a Man (7).jpg": "This portrait shows an unidentified man in middle age. The delicately rendered strands of his graying hair and the salt-and-pepper stubble of his beard, as well as his deeply lined jowls, sagging double chin, and the crow's-feet at the edge of his left eye, are closely observed.",
    "images/KUNST, Cornelis Cornelisz/Scenes from the Life of St. Anthony Abbot.jpg": "The painting shows five scenes from the life of St. Anthony Abbot, a popular saint in the Renaissance.",
    "images/FERRARI, Gaudenzio/The Crucifixion of Christ.jpg": "The Crucifixion assembles, against a painted stage, a dense group of figures to which his painting lends a sculptural liveliness. The mounted good centurion, for example, who is holding up his club in front of the cross, has a precise pendant in Ferrari's Crucifixion in the Cappella della Maddalena in San Cristoforo, Vercelli.",
    "images/HAMEN, Juan van der/Still Life with a Puppy.jpg": "The dog and its playful puppy may well have portrayed actual animals owned by the patron. In one of the pictures, a wine cooler stands on the floor and the side tables covered with green velvet damask display sweetmeats and a glass ewer with aloja, an aromatic drink popular at the time, while the clock shows that it is just before five o'clock, an appropriate time for such treats. The major motifs in these pictures are two large gilt ormolu and glass vases with floral arrangements.",
    "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Crucified Christ.jpg": "To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne.jpg": "The figures and landscapes enshrine images of concord and prosperity and are classical in inspiration. In Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne, Bacchus arrives from the sea with his wreath and skirt of vine leaves, bearing a bunch of grapes and a ring. Among her rocks and drapes, Ariadne feebly extends her ring finger as an airborne Venus crowns her with stars. Ariadne - discovered by Bacchus on the island of Naxos and crowned by Venus to be received amongst the gods - stands for Venice, born on the sea, graced by divine favour and crowned by freedom.",
    "images/TURA, Cosmè/Allegory of August Triumph of Ceres.jpg": "The upper scene depicts the triumphal car of Ceres and agricultural scenes. In the centre the astrological symbol Virgo. Below, Duke Borso receives dignitaries, and setting out on a hunt.",
    "images/MCCULLOCH, Horatio/Kilchurn Castle, Loch Awe.jpg": "This painting depicts the dramatically situated ruin of Kilchurn Castle, which sits at the head of Loch Awe in Argyllshire and is still, today, one of the most picturesque castles in Scotland.",
    "images/SODOMA, Il/Life of St Benedict, Scene 6 A Priest Shares His Easter Meal with Benedict.jpg": "Sodoma illustrates successive phases of a single event. A priest has just finished preparing his Easter dinner. We see him taking it out of the oven in the background. Suddenly Christ appears to him in a vision - he gestures to him from a medallion above the window - urging him to share his dinner with the hermit Benedict. In the foreground to the right the priest recoils from the vision, shading his eyes with his hand. Finally, he appears again on the left, seated across from Benedict at a makeshift stone table as a serving boy waits on them.",
    "images/ELINGA, Pieter Janssens/Interior with Seated Figures.jpg": "The woman sweeping seen from behind is very similar to that in Elinga's other interior in The Hermitage, St Petersburg.",
    "images/GIUSTO de' Menabuoi/Triptych (detail).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the centre panel of the triptych with the Coronation of the Virgin.",
    "images/IBBETSON, Julius Caesar/Landscape with Travellers.jpg": "This painting depicts a landscape with travellers in a horse drawn carriage and figures conversing by a track. In the rural scene, the artist creates a fine contrast between the frenetic coachman, spurring his horses into a furious gallop and the leisurely exchange amongst the group of figures in the foreground of the work.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/St Luke Drawing the Portrait of the Madonna (2).jpg": "The figures are seen in a vaulted portico opening onto an inner garden. The space is situated in a fortress raised above earthly life, the city below and the river landscape. Seated on the step of a wooden throne, over which a canopy is hung, the Virgin is suckling the Child. St Luke sits in front of her. With one knee resting on a cushion, he is drawing her portrait with a silver point on a sheet of paper or parchment supported by a small plank. In the adjacent room behind St Luke lies an open book, probably an allusion to his gospel, and the ox, his emblem. The low position of the Virgin, seated in front of her throne, corresponds to the type of the Virgin of Humility, a motif derived from St Luke's Gospel. On the arm of the throne the Fall of Man is depicted, which is connected with the role of Jesus and Mary as the new Adam and Eve. The two small figures looking over the crenellated wall are sometimes linked with Joachim and Anna, Mary's parents. In the background on the left is a wooden corner-house with a signboard consisting of a stick on which copper dishes are hanging. His clothing too, with the exception of the evangelist's inkpot hanging from his belt, is in fact that of a doctor.",
    "images/SCHMIDT, Martin Johann/Saint Elizabeth Distributing Alms.jpg": "It shows the popular moment when the royal princess, in spite of her family's disapproval, distributes alms to the poor.",
    "images/BROEDERLAM, Melchior/The Flight into Egypt (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the Flight into Egypt on the right wing of the Dijon Altarpiece. St Joseph is leading the donkey by the halter, while he pours drink into his mouth from a small keg. He carries a stick over his left shoulder, from which his coat and a small pot with a ladle have been hung. He is wearing a hood and a surcoat held in by a leather belt at the waist. He has slipped his purse under the belt, and his leather boots seem to have been worn out by the long journey he has made on foot. He has a hooked nose, a curly beard and bushy eyebrows. Broederlam has portrayed him as a rough working man, a tired labourer weighed down by his heavy clothes.",
    "images/RIBERA, Jusepe de/The Holy Family with St Catherine.jpg": "Especially notable is the beautiful still-life as well as the brilliant rendition of the fabrics and the tender expressions.",

    "images/CARPACCIO, Vittore/The Pilgrims Meet the Pope.jpg": "The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls.",

    "images/GOGH, Vincent van/Head of a Peasant Woman with White Cap.jpg": "Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. It shows a woman with heavy features dressed in a white cap and blue jacket typical for the peasant women of the time and region.",

    "images/HOFMANN, Ludwig von/Adam and Eve (Paradise).jpg": "With the two figures in the foreground and the fruit, Hofmann alluded to paradise and Adam and Eve motifs, which the artist repeated in paintings, pastels and drawings, especially in his early work in the 1890s, and processed them in a very varied manner. The influence of Puvis de Chavannes can be seen in the picture.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/The Last Judgment (detail) (1).jpg": "Above is a cloud of gold, on which are seated the apostles, judges in the celestial tribunal, as well as a pope, a bishop, a king, a monk and three women. Below them is the earth, from which the resurrected souls emerge, to go either to damnation or to eternal bliss.",
    "images/LEONARDO da Vinci/The Last Supper (detail).jpg": "The main figure of the composition is Jesus in the centre.",
    "images/RANSON, Paul Elie/Digitalis.jpg": "A woman stands in the forest, surrounded by plants and trees. The four sides of the canvas are framed by decorative borders reminiscent of tapestries. Digitalis (foxglove), the plant with purplish-red bell-shaped blossoms, grows in large form across the foreground.",
    "images/COLI, Giovanni/Vault decoration.jpg": "The picture shows vault border scenes (trophies, weapons, armour, standards, and groups of Oriental figures) in the Grande Galleria in the Palazzo Colonna. They are part of the splendidly colourful decoration of the gallery, in which heraldic, ornamental, and figural motifs combine to create a dizzying spectacle.",
    "images/WEYDEN, Rogier van der/Braque Family Triptych (closed).jpg": "The left frame bears a saying in French uttered by the skull: \"See, you who are so proud and avaricious, my body was once beautiful but now is food for worms..\" This skull is intended as a \"likeness\" of the dead Jean Braque, whose coat-of-arms is shown above it, reminding viewers of their mortality. The inscription on the cross on the right is from the apocryphal Book of Ecclesiasticus (Chapter 41, 1-2) and laments the bitterness of death.",
    "images/HAYEZ, Francesco/Meditation on the History of Italy.jpg": "She is sunk in thought, looking out of the canvas in a pre-occupied way. In her right hand she holds a folio bearing the words \"Storia d'Italia\", this is to say a symbol of knowledge. Her left hand holds the symbol of faith, the Cross, that has played so great a part in Italy's history. Her naked breast is highly provocative when seen with the black cross of mourning. She seems to be in a state between waking and dreaming.",
    "images/HOREMANS, Jan Jozef I/Capriccio Scene.jpg": "The painting represents a scene with two soldiers propositioning a young egg seller.",
    "images/CARAVAGGIO/The Calling of Saint Matthew (detail) (3).jpg": "Matthew brings his hand to his chest, as though to ask if it were he that they wanted.",
    "images/DOMENICO VENEZIANO/The Madonna and Child with Saints (detail) (2).jpg": "Lucy is shown in sharp and magnificent profile on the extreme right, while Zenobius turns easily in three-quarter view, balancing John in importance, for both are patron saints of Florence.",
    "images/CLAUDE LORRAIN/Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helion (Parnassus).jpg": "Apollo, as the God of Poetry and Music (in this role named Apollo Musagetes), dwells on Mount Parnassus, accompanied by the muses, the goddesses of poetic inspiration and the creative arts in general. The running brook is the Castilian spring, which, like another, the Pierian, was a source of inspiration and learning where we are advised to drink deep.",
    "images/SIMBERG, Hugo/Death and the Peasant.jpg": "These demonic creatures can appear either mischievous or sorrowful.",
    "images/MURA, Francesco de/The Holy Family at Work.jpg": "In the half-lunettes flanking the façade-wall window appear the Rest on the Rest on the Flight into Egypt and The Holy Family at Work. These paintings include everyday objects and their settings, a charming landscape and a domestic idyll.",
    "images/GENTILESCHI, Artemisia/St Catherine of Alexandria (1).jpg": "The painting represents St Catherine of Alexandria, holding the palm of her martyrdom in one hand and her book in the other which she props up on the spiked wheel (an instrument of her martyrdom).",
    "images/ANGELI, Giuseppe/The Sacrifice of Iphigenia.jpg": "The two large scenes that extend between the doors on the walls in the ballroom are taken from Greek mythology and depict The Sacrifice of Iphigenia and The Abduction of Helen. The Sacrifice of Iphigenia shows the moment when the priest is about to inflict the mortal knife blow upon Agamemnon's young daughter, who is condemned to be sacrificed to Diana to atone for the insult to the goddess caused by Agamemnon, who killed her sacred stag during a hunt. At the last moment, the goddess, moved by the young girl's tragic fate, has a stag descend from the sky to be sacrificed in place of Iphigenia, who in turn will become one of Diana's priestesses.",
    "images/TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista/The Virgin Appearing to Dominican Saints.jpg": "The Virgin Mary hovers on a throne-like golden yellow cloud beneath a baldachin in front of Renaissance architecture, dressed in brilliant reds and blues and accompanied by angels. In the foreground are the three saints, all members of the Dominican order. Agnes of Montepulciano (1274-1317) sits at the front and meditates over a small crucifix. Her robes illusionistically jut out into the viewer's space. To her left stands St Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) with a crown of thorns and a crucifix, and St Rose of Lima (1586-1617), holding the Christ Child in her arms.",
    "images/MATTEO di Giovanni/The Apostle St Bartholomew.jpg": "Matteo di Giovanni, however, was not content with the type of representation customary in Tuscany, holding his skin in hand but smartly dressed. He preferred to follow an old Umbrian iconographic tradition and to portray the already flayed Apostle as an athletic nude wearing his skin elegantly as a stole over his shoulder.",
    "images/PIAZZETTA, Giovanni Battista/The Soothsayer.jpg": "The artist's masterpiece in this phase of his activity was \"The Soothsayer\" the real subject of which is the meeting of two young peasant girls with one of them trying to attract the attention of the little dog which her companion is rather nonchalantly holding in her left arm. This moment of everyday life is transformed into pastoral idyll by the extremely careful fitting together of the planes of the scene and the grouping of the figures who are dominated by the glowing beauty of the young country-girl on whom the \"lumo solivo\" concentrates and who thus becomes the highest note of the rich symphony of chromatic shadings.",
    "images/LIPPI, Filippino/The Coronation of the Virgin.jpg": "The lyrical and graceful line - the rippling cascades of drapery and the fanlike fall of cloth at the Virgin's hem - show Filippino's debt to his teacher, but the confident colours are the artist's own.",
    "images/ZUCCARO, Taddeo/Scene from the History of the Farnese Family (2).jpg": "The ceiling shows the coronation of the pope in the centre, surrounded by four further events. The walls rehearse a series of the pope's acts that had already been depicted in the Cancellaria or in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The picture shows the scene of Paul III Opens the Council of Trent in 1546.",
    "images/NICCOLÒ DI PIETRO GERINI/Christ on the Cross with the Virgin, Sts John and Mary Magdalene.jpg": "The Madonna's pose, forming a diagonal line echoing that of the prostrate Mary Magdalene, provides the scene with sense of movement which is amplified by the rippling folds of her mantle, falling from her raised arms.",
    "images/MANTEGNA, Andrea/Triumphs of Caesar (scene 2, detail).jpg": "The scene at the centre is the intense discussion between a soldier and an officer.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) (12).jpg": "The picture shows a detail of the left wing, representing the Salamander (after Fraenger).",
    "images/FERENCZY, Károly/Joseph Sold into Slavery by his Brothers.jpg": "The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.",
    "images/REQUESTA, Giovanni Antonio/Conversion of the Tyrant Ezzelino.jpg": "In this scene St Anthony is calming and converting the tyrant Ezzelino, who represented a threat to Padua from outside.",
    "images/TINTORETTO/The Adoration of the Magi (detail) (2).jpg": "Balthazar is beautiful, bending forward and wearing a turban that shines like a multicoloured jewel in the faint half-shadow.",
    "images/HACKERT, Jacob Philipp/Autumn.jpg": "The painting depicts a grape harvest and the view of Sorrento, the Gulf of Naples and the islands.",
    "images/CLAESZ., Pieter/Vanitas Still-Life (1).jpg": "This painting represents a vanitas still-life with a book, a glass roemer, a skull, a lute, a pack of cards and piece of parchment on a table.",
    "images/MICHELE DI MATTEO/Polyptych of Sant'Elena.jpg": "It depicts the Virgin and Child enthroned with Sts Lucy, Helen, Mary Magdalene, and Catherine of Alexandria in the centre, the Crucifixion set in the middle of the Four Evangelists in the upper section, and episodes from the Recovery of the True Cross on the predella.",
    "images/STOSKOPFF, Sébastien/Still-Life with Glasses and Bottles.jpg": "This painting shows a large number of thin, Venetian-style glasses in a wicker basket. Surrounded by other glass, clay and china vessels the basket, which is parallel to the edge of the painting, has been placed on a brilliantly white tablecloth that hangs down over the edge and forms a sharp contrast to the dark background. Stosskopf may well have depicted the costly drinking vessels of an aristocratic patron.",
    "images/HONDECOETER, Gillis Claesz. d'/Landscape.jpg": "The picture shows a landscape with deer, goats and travellers on a country path, a riverside house beyond.",
    "images/SON, Joris van/Still-Life (1).jpg": "This signed and dated still-life includes grapes, a melon, an orange, plums and oysters in a stone niche.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Last Judgment (detail).jpg": "At the centre of the fresco stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the lefthand side, who are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld; while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength. Together with the planets and the sun, the saints surround the Judge, confined into vast spacial orbits around Him.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/Infanta Doña María, Queen of Hungary.jpg": "Every detail, for instance the typically protuberant Habsburg lower lip, shows a striking similarity to the living model. The delicate carmine of her lips, the beautiful Titian shade of her hair, depicted in relaxed brushstrokes with dark brown shadows and bright yellow highlights, all display the artistic skill now at the command of Velázquez in his harmonious combination of state splendour with the individuality of his sitter.",
    "images/KESSEL, Jan van, I/Still-Life.jpg": "This panel, typical of Jan van Kessel's fish still life style, shows a still-life of fish in a harbour landscape.",
    "images/PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA/Polyptych of St Anthony.jpg": "The central part of the composition, the Madonna and Child with Saints Anthony, John the Baptist, Francis and Elizabeth, reveals in its unusual damask-like background the artist's acquaintance with a trend of contemporary Spanish painting, which Piero would have had the opportunity to see in Rome. The polyptych is also made up of three predella panels showing St Anthony of Padua resurrecting a child, the Stigmatisation of St Francis and St Elizabeth saving a boy who had fallen down a well, as well as two roundels placed between the main panel and the predella. Each architrave, and each column as well, projects a thin strip of shadow into the splendid cloister arcade, which appears to go beyond any inspiration derived from Alberti's architecture.",
    "images/VELÁZQUEZ, Diego Rodriguez de Silva y/The Fable of Arachne (detail) (1).jpg": "There is a second room in the background, in an alcove reached by steps. It is flooded with light and contains several elegantly dressed women. The woman on the left wearing an antique helmet and with her arm raised is a figure of Athena. Opposite her - either really in the room, or part of the picture in the tapestry on the back wall? - stands the young Arachne, who has committed the sacrilegious act of comparing her skill in weaving with the goddess's. She has begun their competition with a tapestry showing one of the love affairs of Jupiter, the rape of Europa.",
    "images/RENI, Guido/Interior view looking toward the choir.jpg": "In the small cupola of the main room we are shown God's election of Mary surrounded by choirs of angels, and in the pendentive below appear the four prophets Moses, David, Solomon, and Isaiah. In the lunettes of the main room the scenes Presentation of Mary to the Temple (left) and Annunciation to Joachim (right) are depicted. The cupola-like vault of the choir shows God the Father with arms outspread, surrounded by a glory of angels singing the Virgin's praises. The nude figure of Adam in the niche to the left of the altar alludes the original sin, which has been overcome thanks to Mary's contribution. Mary, wearing a red dress and with her hair falling loosely across her shoulders, is bent over her sewing. She is framed by two adult angels while above her hover two putti with inscription ribbons alluding to her predestined role as mother of God. On the inner façade above the door the multifigured scene of Mary's birth is painted. The barrel vault and the lunettes in the extensions off the choir are filled with vivacious, charmingly arranged, frolicking putti with inscription ribbons and symbols of the Virgin (lily, palm branches, rose bush, olive branches) that combine to form an aesthetically pleasing ensemble. The picture shows a view of the chapel toward the choir: in the vault, God the Father giving benediction with angels, the altarpiece with Reni's Annunciation to the Virgin.",
    "images/DAVID, Jacques-Louis/Portrait of Emilie Sériziat and her Son.jpg": "Madame Sériziat is shown in an interior setting with her young son, having just returned from a walk. Her cheeks are ruddy and she carries a recently picked bunch of wild flowers which are painted in a lively but meticulous manner.",
    "images/TIZIANO Vecellio/Portrait of Jacopo (Giacomo) Dolfin.jpg": "His Portrait of Jacopo (Giacomo) Dolfin - perhaps commissioned to commemorate the sitter's appointment as provincial governor of the mainland city of Treviso in 1532 - shows him dressed in his somberly opulent official crimson robes, and displaying an identifying letter with a simple gesture of his right hand. His severe and somewhat inscrutable facial expression is appropriate to a nobleman appointed to weighty responsibility.",
    "images/BOLLONGIER, Hans/Flower Piece.jpg": "A bouquet of striped tulips, a rose, an orange lily, a red and white carnation, stocks and a cyclamen.",
    "images/NARDO DI CIONE/Madonna and Child with Sts Peter and John the Evangelist.jpg": "Nardo's Virgin, despite her soft expression, appears removed from human concerns. Bright, artificial colours separate her from the real world, and the stiff saints on either side underscore her hierarchical importance.",
    "images/MINDERHOUT, Hendrik van/The Battle of Lowestoft.jpg": "The painting depicts the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665, showing HMS 'Royal Charles' and the 'Eendracht'. The left foreground is dominated by the duelling flagships of the two commanders-in-chief. On the left is the 'Royal Charles', with the Duke of York on board, and the Royal crest is shown carved on her stern. A small boat is connected to the ship by a rope held by two men and other men can be seen working in the rigging. In very close action to the right is the 'Eendracht' with the carved lion visible on her stern, and flying the Dutch flag and ensign, just before she blew up.",
    "images/DUCCIO di Buoninsegna/Polyptych No. 47 (detail) (3).jpg": "The picture shows the figure of Christ in the upper part of the polyptych.",
    "images/COSSA, Francesco/Allegory of April (detail) (2).jpg": "The detail shows the upper part of the lower layer of the Allegory of April. The scene represents the Palio (race) of Ferrara.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/Medallion (5).jpg": "It is either David before the Prophet Nathan, or Alexander before the High Priest of Jerusalem. The soldier at left was made by 'al secco' technique.",
    "images/DELACROIX, Eugène/The Massacre at Chios.jpg": "Delacroix depicted a landscape racked with fire, stretching desolately behind a group of prisoners awaiting execution.",
    "images/SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO/View of the Loggia di Galatea.jpg": "On the left Sebastiano del Piombo depicted the cyclops Polyphemus sitting on a charming, idyllic coastline with a dog, a flute, sand a shepherd's crook. He is looking longingly at the sea, out to the right, where in the adjacent field of the wall Raphael depicted the voyage of the nereid Galatea.",
    "images/JORDAENS, Jacob/The Bean King (2).jpg": "The painting captures The Festival of the Bean King - celebrated on January 6th. Three people are recognizable in the painting: \"The Bean King\" - Jordaens' father-in-law; the woman to the left - Jordaens' wife, Elizabeth; and the man with the upraised pitcher, Jordaens himself.",
    "images/MAINARDI, Bastiano/Annunciation (detail) (1).jpg": "The detail shows the right side of the fresco depcting the Virgin.",
    "images/MICHELANGELO Buonarroti/The ceiling (detail) (1).jpg": "The picture shows a transversal section of the ceiling with a larger field of the apex of the ceiling. It demonstrates the following additional design elements:  two of the eight spheric triangles above the lunettes, with frescoes depicting the ancestors of Christ;  four of the twenty-four bronze nudes flanking ram heads at the triangles and spandrels;  one of the four larger fields of the apex containig a scene from the Genesis (The Creation of Adam).",
    "images/NARDO DI CIONE/Sts John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and James (1).jpg": "St John the Evangelist carries his Gospel, St James carries a book and a pilgrim's staff.",
    "images/BOSCH, Hieronymus/Last Judgment Triptych (detail).jpg": "The detail from the central panel depicts the sin of Gluttony and its punishment. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead.",
    "images/LASTMAN, Pieter Pietersz/Odysseus and Nausicaa.jpg": "The artist has taken a highly original approach in placing the figures, with their gestures of surprise and fright and their outstretched arms, against a pale sky - a motif Rembrandt was soon to adopt. In this painting, the naked Odysseus not only looks like the great hero of the Trojan war, but he is also caricatured in his all too human role.",
    "images/HEEMSKERCK, Maerten van/Lamentation on the Dead Christ.jpg": "The elongated figures, the metallic colours follow Italian examples, however, the traditional dramatic Flemish realism of Van deer Goes or Massys is also present."
