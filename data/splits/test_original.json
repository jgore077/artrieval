Some of the walls and ceilings in the catacombs display fine decorations illustrating Biblical scenes. They contain many wall paintings representing saints and early Christian symbols. Particularly notable is the \"Greek Chapel\" (Cappella Greca), a square chamber with an arch which contains 2nd and 3rd century frescoes generally interpreted to be Old and New Testament scenes, including the Fractio Panis. This painting is found upon the face of the arch immediately over the altar tomb, upon which the sacrament of the Eucharist was performed. The scene represents seven persons at a table, six men and a woman. Six of these are reclining as the ancients reclined at their meals. But the seventh person, a bearded figure, sits somewhat apart at the extremity of the table. His head is thrown back, he has a small loaf or cake in his hands, and his arms stretched out in front of him show that he is breaking it. Upon the table immediately before him is a two-handled cup. Further along the table there are two large plates, one containing two fishes, the other five loaves. At each extremity of the picture upon either side we notice baskets filled with loaves — four baskets at one end, three at the other. In liturgy, Fractio panis (Latin: Breaking of the bread) is the rite of breaking the sacramental bread within the Eucharistic celebration before distribution to communicants.",

The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone.

Recent cleaning showed the painting to be less damaged than had initially been feared, and uncovered the uppermost part of the house that can be made out hazily through the stained glass of the right window.

Until recently, the composition of the same subject in the National Gallery of Art, Washington was identified as the painting sent to England. However, it is debated now which of the two paintings was really sent to England. Saint George is one of the most popular of Christian saints and is the patron saint of England. He was also a favourite subject of Renaissance artists, who depicted him slaying the dragon. According to legend, this monster infested a marsh outside the walls of a city and, with his fiery breath, could poison all who came near. In order to placate the dragon, the city furnished him with a few sheep every day. But when the supply of sheep was exhausted, the sons and daughters of the citizens became the victims. The lot fell one day on the princess, and the King reluctantly sent her forth to the dragon. Saint George happened to be riding by and, seeing the maiden in tears, commended himself to God and transfixed the dragon with his spear. St George's lance has been broken in the struggle, but the proud knight is about to vanquish the dragon with the sword, and so free the princess, who is fleeing on the right. By the middle of the 16th century this panel formed a pair with Raphael's St. Michael. Even though the latter was painted somewhat earlier, the fact that they are the same size and have a comparable iconography implies that Raphael intended that the saints should belong together.",

The Sassetti Chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: \"This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.\" The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole. An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting. In Ghirlandaio's altarpiece, the shepherds pushing their way into the picture from the right, with their harsh, life-like features, are drawn directly from this Flemish model.

The theory, supported by some scholars, that this altarpiece actually dates from 1510 when Carpaccio supposedly repainted it since the original version had been badly damaged, has been disproved by a recent X-ray of the whole painting (which has, incidentally, revealed that the three splendid male portraits to the left are later additions). But the theory can also be disproved by a stylistic analysis: compare it, for instance, to the Presentation in the Temple, which dates from around 1510, also in the Accademia. The complexity of the perspective foreshortening of the marble aedicula, of the furled banners, of the figure of Ursula surrounded by angels and with God the Father looking down at her, is far too self-conscious and still too close to the style of Mantegna to be the work of the established artist active around 1510. Both the central episode of the composition and the heads of the virgin martyrs crowded in the lower part of the painting show quite clearly that this altarpiece dates from the same stylistic period as the painting depicting the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne. And even the artist's reluctance to reconcile the devotional and iconographical aspect of the work to the narrative and dramatic elements, which he was more interested in, suggest an early dating.

The Chiostrino dei Morti (Cloister of the Dead), a former cemetery already built around 1270 by the Dominicans, probably by reusing a former cloister of the canons that we know as existing in 1179, was remodeled to its current size in 1337-1350. It presents on two sides vaulted arches lowered on octagonal fourteenth century pillars with overlying gallery, supported by very projecting corbels, leading from the dormitory to the sacristy of the church. It opens on it the funeral chapel of the Strozzis with two walls painted with the Nativity and the Crucifixion, attributed to Andrea Orcagna or his school. The frescoes, like most of those in the church and the convent, were removed, restored and replaced after the flood damages of Florence (1966). Through the division with walls of various spans, there were obtained several chapels: the Chapel of St Anne, with Stories of St Anne and Mary, frescoes attributed to the circle of Nardo di Cione; the Chapel of St Paul, with the Crucifixion and St Dominic, damaged frescoes by Orcagna's school.",

The interior view of the left wing depicts the Fall of the Rebel Angels, Creation of Eve, Fall of Man and Expulsion, while the interior view of the right wing shows Hell and the Prince of Darkness. The inclusion of the Fall of Adam and Eve in a representation of the Last Judgment is unusual; the other two panels of the Vienna triptych depart even more from traditional iconography. Generally Heaven was allotted the chief role in the eschatological drama. As in the altarpiece by Roger van der Weyden, it is the act of judgment which is stressed; the judged are relegated to positions of secondary importance, and the felicity of the saved is described as fully as the pains of the lost. In Bosch's version, however, the divine court appears small and insignificant at the top of the central panel, and very few souls are numbered among the elect. The majority of mankind has been engulfed in the universal cataclysm which rages throughout the deep, murky landscape below. This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as Dürer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: \"Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes\". Bosch was probably also influenced by the account of the last days given in the Revelation of St John, a book which enjoyed renewed popularity in the late fifteenth century, when it was illustrated by Dürer in his famous Apocalypse woodcuts of 1497-98. The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background. In any event, earth has become indistinguishable from Hell, depicted on the right wing, out of which the army of Satan swarms to attack the damned; the eternity of torment has begun. The Hell scene in the Prado Tabletop had paired off each punishment with one of the Deadly Sins. In the Last Judgment it would be difficult to identify the punishments with specific sins. The avaricious are boiled in the great cauldron just visible beneath one of the buildings in the central panel. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead. The lascivious woman on the roof above suffers the attentions of a lizard-like monster slithering across her loins, while being serenaded by two musical demons. On the cliffs to the right, across the river, blacksmith-devils hammer other victims on anvils, and one is being shod like a horse; these unfortunate souls are guilty of the sin of anger.",

He was named after his principal work, the former altarpiece in the Augustinian Canons' church in Wittingau, now Trebon, in southern Bohemia. Its high altar was consecrated in 1378; the altarpiece was perhaps already completed at this point, or finished soon afterwards. The Master of Trebon must certainly have been active by no later than 1395, since the Jérén epitaph of this date makes clear stylistic references to his art. His paintings for Wittingau coincided with the reform of the monastery, in which the emperor played an active role. Hence, too, it is suspected that his workshop was in Prague, rather than in southern Bohemia. The master employed assistants on the Wittingau Altar. He had a large workshop and was extremely influential in his own day We can only speculate about his artistic origins. He shows no evidence of any links with Italian art. His starting-point was undoubtedly older Bohemian painting. The Master of Trebon may also have been influenced by Franco-Flemish panel painting. In his innovative interpretation of subject and composition, and above all as a colourist, the Master of Trebon is outstanding amongst the artists of central Europe between 1350 and 1400. The retable which once stood on the high altar of the Augustinian Canons' church in Trebon today survives only in fragments. It is nevertheless clear that the Resurrection panels, formerly visible on the weekday side of the altar, is the work of a master of European standing. The intensity with which the artist has re-thought and re-interpreted his subject is also clear. The risen Christ has floated through and out of the closed and sealed tomb. We are shown not the moment of resurrection, but the state of being resurrected. The painter presents the event as a true miracle. The watchmen fix their eyes on the apparition as if entranced.",

The story of the archangel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she, though a virgin, was to give birth to the Messiah depicts in a few verses the reality and the functions of angels. The angel was sent by God to this world to make the announcement. Since God's realm was thought of as \"above\" our world, angels are often visually represented with wings, much the way Jupiter's messenger, Mercury, had wings on his sandals, hat, and wand. How else but by flying could God's messengers get from heaven to earth and back? Angels in the Christian tradition are not gods like the pagan Mercury, but are special messengers of the one God. They are creatures whose being is above that of humans but not equal to that of God. Mary trusts the angel and responds to God's message because she recognizes Gabriel as a superior being used by God to make his message credible. Hence she responds, \"I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let what you have said be done to me.\"",

We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin. Elsheimer's unique art is evident in the astonishing illusion of remarkable breadth and depth achieved by this small panel painting. Here, space is no longer simply a problem of continuously reduced scale, but also one of simultaneous graduation of colour and the distribution of light and darkness. This creates interlocking areas of colour and light which, though perceived by the eye, nevertheless take on the quality of a vision. This painting, originally part of a triptych, is widely regarded as Elsheimer's greatest masterpiece.",

The group of the twelve  apostles are looking out of the picture. Dr. Rezsõ Pertorini, author of the Csontváry pathogaph, grouped them as people shouting, \"Crucify him,\" as if they were a choir in a Greek tragedy. Faces are suggestive, those of the Saviour and Moses are expressive. The picture condenses events. Moses is standing with stone tablets on the left. The silhouette of a town can be seen in the background, it is Jerusalem. On the right, there is a slim tree with a block of stone at its foot with two black figures tumbling on it. Behind the tree, there is a modern church which is lit: it can be approached on a steep slope. Next to it, there are three columns with winged sculptures and a domed building on the left. A group of people are approaching the church. The picture has a complicated and symbolic message, in fact, the painter attempted to sum up the history of christianity. He portrayed the Old Testament on the left and the New Testament on the right: the former  being represented by Moses and the tables of the Testament, and the New Testament by Jesus' sermon, payer, and desciples, the tree symbolizing the cross, and the mourners with a stone suggesting a grave. There are symbolic objects and scenes on both sides. The  background stretches out to the distance. Thus, the painter emphasizes the main characters. The composition is balanced. The connection between time and space, and the suggestivity of tools with expressive power are in  harmony with one another.",

The lozenge-shaped arrangement of the four figures represented in the foreground of the painting was probably suggested to Pontormo by Dürer's engraving portraying the Four Witches (1497). Entirely original, on the other hand are the intertwining arcs of arms and fabric that firmly unites the two protagonists whose distinctly enlarged bodies dominate the painted surface. The monumental scene is depicted in a frozen fashion against the background of a roughly painted, funereally gloomy town. The profile portrayal of the two main figures embracing each other with extreme delicacy and exchanging looks of intense mutual affection is set against the rigidly frontal positions of the two bystanders in the background. Immobile, almost petrified, the latter keep their eyes fixed on something outside the scene, revealing their total lack of emotional participation in the event. The age difference between these two women and their facial resemblance with the protagonists invite an interpretation of the two maidservants as the doubles of Mary and Elisabeth. Their expressions convey a rather melancholic tone to the scene's general atmosphere of high spirituality.",

It was El Greco's first commission upon his arrival in Toleedo in 1577. It gained great fame in Toledo, which was artistically rather archaic and provincial, and established a successful career for El Greco in the town. Here the reference is to Rome, rather than to Venice, and specifically to Michelangelo, developing the motif of the Pietà. The general scheme of the composition of the Trinity, however, refers to Dürer's engraving of the same subject. The composition continues that of the Assumption below, slowing down the upward movement which finally comes to rest in the supported shoulders of Christ. Form is more in evidence here than in the Assumption, especially in the Michelangelesque motif of the naked Christ (for which the artist probably drew inspiration from Michelangelo's  Pietà for Vittoria Colonna), and it is only later that he treats his figures with the same freedom as draperies. Here the suggestion of weight in the supported Dead Christ is appropriate. The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos. El Greco was not to repeat this subject.",

The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile. Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.

        "description": "Inscription in the top left: HIERONIMVS HOLTZSHVER ANNO DO[MI]NI 1526 AETATIS SVE 57; to the right, near the head, monogrammed. Dürer painted this portrait in Nuremberg in 1526, when the sitter was 57 years old. Hieronymus Holzschuher (1469-1529) came from an old Nuremberg patrician family. In 1500 he was elected junior, and nine years later senior burgomaster. In 1514 he ranked as one of the seven Elders of the city government, and on his death in 1529 a commemorative medal bearing his profile was struck. Holzschuher was a fearless champion of the reformation movement in Nuremberg. In Dürer, who was only slightly younger, he found both a sympathizer and a friend. When the painter visited the Netherlands in 1521, he bought presents for Holzschuher, a fact which he noted in his diary. The artist has filled almost the whole of the upper half of the panel with his subject's powerful head, for which the upper part of the body, clad in heavy fur, seems merely to serve as a plinth, attention being focused on the features. In this portrait Dürer has reproduced details with incredible fidelity. The fine brush has rendered the thick, wavy hair, which has receded somewhat over the forehead, with all the delicacy of a pen-and-ink drawing. At the same time, the face and the full lips are strongly modelled and determine the full-blooded vitality of the man. Reflected in the sitter's eyes are the window-bars of the room in which Dürer worked. Dürer himself fitted to the frame a sliding cover bearing Holzschuher's coat of arms; frame and cover are still extant in their original state and have served for centuries to protect the picture. Dürer was renowned for his ability to paint details, such as hair, realistically and it was pictures like this which are said to have led to his famous conversation with Giovanni Bellini in 1505 or 1506. The elderly Venetian painter had asked Dürer for one of the brushes which he used to execute his painstaking portraits. Dürer then handed Bellini a brush identical to ones the Venetian artist already used. `I do not mean this, I mean the brushes you use to paint several hairs with one touch,' Bellini responded. Dürer picked up the brush and demonstrated how he painted. In 1651 when the painter and art-historian Joachim von Sandrart was commissioned by some distinguished personality, possibly the Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria, to purchase the panel, his offer was turned down on the ground that it was intended to remain in the subject's family as a permanent memorial to him. During the eighteenth century the picture remained, well looked-after, in a groundfloor room of the family residence. Then, with the growth of romanticism in the early nineteenth century, there was a revival of interest in German painting and this famous portrait was brought out into the light of day. The new-found enthusiasm for Dürer's art made this particular portrait more popular than almost any other work of his. When it was publicly exhibited for the first time in Munich in 1869, it had already been accepted as epitomizing the old German patrician class. The portrait remained in the possession of Holzschuher's descendants in Nuremberg until it was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1884.",

This altarpiece depicting St Anne, Madonna and Child with five angels (called Sant'Anna Metterza) was originally painted for the Sant'Ambrogio Church in Florence. Deriving from the Tuscan dialect of the 13th and 14th centuries, the term Metterza means \"she is in the third position\", referring to such iconography where Anna, being mother and grandmother of Christ, appears in third position. The structure of this work is simple yet extraordinarily monumental. The succession of planes is compact and follows an upward direction, thus creating a pyramid shape. The composition can certainly attributed to Masaccio who executed only the Madonna and Child and the two angels (the upper right-hand one, and the one looking down from on high). St Anne and the other angels are the work of Masolino. A sense of grave dignity and power emanates from the faces, from the expressions and from the solidity of the bodies. In 1940 art critic Roberto Longhi attributed to Masolino the execution of part of the painting that previously was ascribed in its entirety to Masaccio by Vasari.",

The body of Christ bears the stigmata of the Crucifixion. His right hand is raised in the gesture of benediction, while in the left He holds a staff surmounted by a cross. In the confined space between the sarcophagus and the enclosing fence four armed soldiers lie in a deep sleep. The Resurrection is one of the panels from a winged altar of considerable dimensions which has been lost without trace. Originally there was a carved central shrine, in which a Crucifixion group was probably represented. When the wings were closed, the altar showed four scenes relating to the Madonna; these (from top left to bottom right) were The Nativity, The Adoration of the Magi, The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin. When opened, the inner sides of the wings showed four scenes from the Passion, which flanked the central Crucifixion. Thus Christ on the Mount of Olives (top left), served as a companion-piece to Christ before Pilate (top right), while Christ bearing the Cross (bottom left), was placed opposite The Resurrection. The original location of the altar has never been established. When it was dismantled, the front and rear sides of the wings became separated. On the two lower panels of the closed altar, showing The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin, the artist appended his signature : `bitte got für hanssen muoltscheren vo richehove burg ze ulm haut dz werk gemacht do ma zalt MCCCCXXXVII'. Records show that in 1437 the Swabian artist, who came from Reichenhafen near Leutkirch, became a burgher of Ulm, where he worked not only as a painter but more often as a sculptor and engraver. The strength and solidity of the painted figures and their remarkable realism leave one in no doubt that Multscher combined the skills of both sculptor and painter, even though, in keeping with medieval practice, he may well have made use of a well-staffed workshop.",

Judas the traitor is the only one to be separated from the others: he is seated in front of the table. The earliest example of the Last Supper was painted in 1476 by Ghirlandaio in the abbey of San Michele Arcangelo a Passignano (in Tavernelle Val di Pesa, near Florence). This is strongly influenced by Andrea del Castagno. The Apostles and Christ are sitting together in a room with a flat ceiling that appears to be too low. Judas is sitting opposite Christ on a three-legged stool in front of the laid table. The figures are set back some distance from us, to a depth of three large floor tiles. The various emotions of the Apostles are indicated by stiff hand movements that scarcely seem alive and express little of the character of the individuals.",

There he joined the Schildersbent, the informal band of Flemish, Dutch and German painters in Rome that included Poelenburg, Both, and Swanevelt. From a stylistic point of view, however, he was more influenced by his exposure to the neo-Venetian, classical experience of Poussin and his circle. Moving from Rome to Naples, where he stayed from 1638-39 to 1648, Schönfeld was an important vehicle for the transfer of this Roman style to that city. In the art world of Naples, where the hierarchical division between the genres was more pronounced, he specialized in painting subjects from ancient history and mythology. It was his aptitude in this area that drew the attention of Flavio Chigi, whom he met during the course of his second stay at Rome. Schönfeld would become one of the cardinal's favourite artists. The clear and subtle colours, the vibrant and nervous brushstrokes, and the strong, direct light render his figures evanescent and almost unstable.

The contract specified that El Greco was to paint the altarpieces himself and design and gild the frames. The centrepiece of the decorative scheme was to be a painting of Saint Joseph and the Infant Christ with The Coronation of the Virgin above it. These two paintings, set in an altarpiece in a Palladian style designed by El Greco, though its surroundings were altered by Baroque additions around 1665, are still in situ; recent cleaning has revealed their masterly quality. In addition, El Greco was commissioned to paint two side altarpieces, Saint Martin and the Beggar hung on the left-hand side of the main altar, while The Virgin and Child with Saints Martina and Agnes was placed directly opposite, on the right-hand side of the altar, where they remained until they were sold in 1906 to the American collector Peter A. B. Widener, from his estate they entered the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1942. The chapel was consecrated on 24 December 1594. At a later date, two sarcophagi were placed on either side of the main altar. Possibly designed by El Greco or his son Jorge Manuel, they are similar in design to the ark and the obelisk with a ball on top that appear in the background of El Greco's late Purification of the Temple from San Ginés. Martín Ramírez was buried to the left of the altar while Diego Ortíz and his wife were placed to the right, in each case with a plaque above stating that they were co-founders of the chapel.

The painting Sappho and Phaon was commissioned by the wealthy Russian diplomat and art collector Prince Nicolas Yusupov, who lived in Paris from 1808 to 1811. Sappho was a poetess on the Greek island of Lesbos and her affection for the young women of the cult of Aphrodite was the origin of the word 'lesbian'. However, she fell in love with the beautiful youth Phaon, the protégé of Venus, and when he only briefly reciprocated her love, she leapt to her death from the rocks at Leucadia. Though this theme of legendary or mythological lovers was similar to that of The Loves of Paris and Helen of 1788, in this painting the couple are not totally self-absorbed and instead look out at the viewer, Phaon staring intensely and Sappho intoxicated with delight at her lover's touch. Indeed, so transported is she that she still believes herself to be playing the lyre that is now held by Cupid. For this picture about the power of physical love and its effect on the individual, David gave his lovers an almost portrait-like degree of characterization, placing them very close to the edge of the picture plane and near to the spectator. To add to the almost unreal sense of mythology come to life he also bathed the scene in harsh daylight and used bright colours and hard contours.",

Van de Velde was active in Haarlem when Molyn joined the guild there. Not much later, Molyn probably met Jan van Goyen, who was sent to Haarlem around 1617 to study with van de Velde.

An angel then told him that he would have to walk barefoot, carrying the cross in humility, as Christ did. Heraclius followed the angel's advice, whereupon  the stones sprang back into place, the gate was opened, and he was then able to return the cross to its proper place. In Piero's cycle the scene is presented in a somewhat different version. Heraclius, barefoot, has carried the cross up to the walls of Jerusalem. There he and his train are met by a group of men who kneel down before the cross in veneration. The figure of the Emperor is almost entirely illegible now. The Oriental noblemen wear splendid Greek headdresses, the exotic elegance of them had been admired by all Florentines at the time. Piero's interest in these enormous hats, cylindrical or pyramidal in shape, is dictated by the same motives which had driven Paolo Uccello to concentrate on the complex armour of contemporary warriors - the study of shapes and perspective. And the colours of the garments are more lively, too. In the midday light and under the blue sky, they vary from pale blue to violet, from bottle-green to pearl-white. This scene is the confirmation that Piero wishes to depict an ideal mankind, healthy and strong, with a peaceful expression, characterized by calm, measured gestures.

As early as 1749, he was promoted to commodore. He invited the young Reynolds to accompany him to the Mediterranean, as a result of which the painter had the opportunity to visit Italy. This study trip was a milestone for Reynolds. The life-size portrait was his thank- you gift to Keppel after their return in 1752. The two remained friends for life. X-ray pictures show that Reynolds experimented with Keppel's pose, and changed it, but from the outset, there must have been the idea to quote the famous Belvedere Apollo. Keppel's striding posture resembles the classical statue, but is reproduced frontally. The borrowed pose bears the thought of the idealization of the individual. The painting shows the supple painting technique of the early works, carefully executed with soft brushes. Keppel is standing on a small strip of shoreline in front of a steep cliff-face. The dramatic scene relates to an event in 1747, when Keppel, following a shipwreck off the coast of Brittany - hinted at in the background - was arrested and court-martialled. The scenery with the storm, the wild surf, the rocky coast and the flickering lightning is in accordance with the aesthetic of the sublime, and enhances the heroic character of the naval officer, who, unimpressed by the forces of nature, poses for the painter. The pose and the landscape idealize the sitter.",

This tendency is well illustrated by Jacopo Bassano's The Adoration of the Kings. Although he is one of the greatest representatives of the Venetian pictorial tradition, Bassano lived and worked not in Venice itself, but in the modest market town of Bassano on the Venetian mainland from which he derived his name. The painting presents a magnificent pageant as the three kings present to the newborn Child their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The painter's skill in portraying animals, unsurpassed among his contemporaries, is evident in the beautifully observed details of the ox and the ass, on the far left, and the dogs. But these, and the general bustle of the scene, are subjected to the formal order created by the semi-circular sweep of the composition, and by the decoratively repeating patches of intense colour; Bassano does not let his interest in animals and in slices of everyday life - such as the chatting boys and kneeling manservant - detract from the religious significance of the subject. The picturesque ruins on the left, for example, are certainly intended to be symbolic of the decay of pagan antiquity with the coming of Christ. The central figure in the painting, the king in the striped doublet may be identified as a portrait of the painting's patron, Jacopo Gisi. The two page-boys behind him may also be portraits of his sons.",

Saint Francis Xavier (1506-1552) was a Navarrese Basque Roman Catholic missionary, and a co-founder of the Society of Jesus.

Nevertheless, Van der Neer was highly successful: the opulent interiors and the extremely costly materials he so accurately depicted must have appealed to the imagination of his clients. He was admired by many of the crowned heads of Europe and worked as court painter to the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm. The rich, fashionably dressed burghers who are the subject of Elegant Couple in an Interior are shown surrounded by several servants. Van der Neer paid great attention to the costly fabrics of the clothes of the elegant couple in the foreground. He rendered the sheen and transparency of ribbons, embroidery and lace with the utmost care, and the man's beautifully coifed wig received the same meticulous attention to detail. The various elements in the painting have not been forged into a unified whole, however. Eglon van der Neer probably wanted to demonstrate his technical skill in the depiction of details. The great variety of materials is certainly no coincidence. We cannot say with any certainty whether the painting depicts anything more than two people in a stylish interior. The fact that the couple in the background are drinking and their rather too intimate behaviour might indicate that this is a brothel scene.",

The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk. The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition.

It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccolò di Ser Sozzo and Luca di Tommè in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin. The general consensus among art historians is that Niccolò di Ser Sozzo painted the Virgin and Christ Child, Saint Benedict and Saint Stephen while Luca di Tommè painted Saints John the Baptist and Thomas.",

It was subsequently replaced by a mosaic, the original being moved to the Pinacoteca Vaticana. A possible reason for the lightening of the artist's style is the fact that the picture had to match the already completed Martyrdom of St Erasmus by the young Nicolas Poussin, who had in turn modified his style towards a much more Caravaggesque approach, especially in his realistic treatment of the gruesome subject-matter. Neither painter received such a commission again, and these two altarpieces stand out in their respective careers, proving that young French artists did appeal to influential people - in this case officials of the Papacy - with the money to give commission.

        "description": "The artist had a distinguished career within royal circles, succeeding Sir Henry Raeburn as Limner to George IV for Scotland in 1823 and Sir Thomas Lawrence as Principal Painter to the king in 1830. He held this second post during the reigns of William IV and Queen Victoria. The Defence of Saragossa forms part of a group of four paintings purchased by George IV in 1829-30 and still in the Royal Collection. The other paintings are The Spanish Posada: a Guerilla Council of War, The Guerilla's Departure and The Guerilla's Return. The four paintings illustrate a decisive moment in the development of Wilkie's style. His early reputation had been based on genre pictures, mainly of scenes from Scottish life painted in the tradition of Teniers or Ostade, but an extended visit to the Continent in 1825-8, prompted by illness and the need for fresh inspiration, enabled the artist to study the works of major European painters, encouraging him to undertake more expansive historical subjects such as The Defence of Saragossa. Here the bolder composition - conceived on a larger scale - the vigorous handling and fresher colouring are clearly evident. These new aspects of Wilkie's style were derived from his attentive examination of works by Titian, Rubens, Velázquez and Murillo while on the Continent and particularly in Spain. The subjects of the four pictures were inspired by the Spanish insurrection against Napoleon's occupying force. The Spanish defiance of the French is a theme widely recorded in contemporary prose and poetry, partly as a result of the role played by the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War of 1808-14. Of the paintings by Wilkie three are imaginary, but The Defence of Saragossa is based on a specific incident when the French laid siege to the city from June to August 1808. The composition depicts the Spanish guerilla leader, Don Jose Rebolado Palafox y Melci (1775-1847), and the Augustinian friar, Father Consolacion, who together have aimed the gun on the French column at the Convent of Santa Engracia, near the Portillo Gate. The moment shown is that when Agostina Zaragoza, the wife of the gunner dying in the lower left corner, seizes the lighted match and fires the gun at the encroaching forces. Wilkie was able to study the head of Palafox from life while he was in Madrid (Palafox was also painted by Goya [Madrid, Prado]). The priest, Boggiero, another hero of the Spanish resistance, is seen writing a dispatch on the left. Wilkie also discussed his ideas for these pictures with Delacroix in Paris on his return journey from Spain. Indeed, The Defence of Saragossa has been described by one writer as 'this country's answer to Delacroix's Liberty at the Barricades'. The heroine of the picture, known thenceforth as the Maid of Saragossa, became a celebrity in Europe, and Byron extols her heroism in the first canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (stanzas 54-9).",

Before him on a drawing-board lies a half-finished sketch of a bearded man. The same youthful model is to be found in other paintings by Chardin, such as the House of Cards in the National Gallery in London and a similar picture in the Oskar Reinhart collection in Winterthur. The individual features of the sitter and the half-length treatment give the picture the character of a portrait, which was not, however, the artist's intention. Chardin's interest lay in the commonplace, in the aesthetic values of everyday life, which he - like Vermeer - brings out in the still-life posture of those he portrayed. Chardin was received into the Paris Academy in 1728 as an animal and fruit painter. During the 1730s he produced a series of half-length portrayals of children, busily engaged at a table, in the style of The Draughtsman. Following the success of the latter, he produced a second version, which - signed and dated 1737 like the Berlin picture - is now in the Louvre. In 1738 The Draughtsman - which of the two versions is not certain was exhibited in the Paris Salon and in 1940 a mezzotint print by J. Faber brought it to the notice of a wider public. Chardin's work is in striking contrast to the courtly art of his contemporaries, Boucher and Fragonard. In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, he met with considerable success. In a certain sense his pictures represented a bourgeois world, which had grown tired of the cultural domination of the Court. The mere choice of subject satisfied a need for a simpler and more natural life - another component of the age of gallantry - and at the same time, managed to come up to the highest standards of painting. In 1779 this painting was in Unter den Linden, the Berlin palace of Prince Henry, a brother of Frederick II. It may be identical with a picture of Chardin's which the king is known to have bought in 1747 in Paris through Count Rothenburg. The painting, which documentary evidence shows to have been in palaces at Potsdam during the nineteenth century, remained in the possession of the former royal house after the fall of the monarchy and was purchased in 193I for the Berlin Gallery.",

In practically every one of these panels we find centrally placed in the composition the figure of the Virgin or of Christ, surrounded by a round or oval halo. Round the central figure are narrative scenes or a hieratic arrangement of the apostles. This panel, now in Barcelona, is a typical example of such a retable. Its painter is referred to as the Master of Seo de Urgell. There are innumerable contemporary miniatures in which the faces and the drapery of the garments have been painted in a similarly stereotyped manner. Every single figure is schematic: the apostles stand stiffly upright, each one holding some object by which he can be identified - and yet the artist has breathed life into these figures. Christ, judging the world, places his hand on a book with the very gesture that might be used by a student of the law as he closes the codex in which he has sought guidance in reaching a fair jjudgment.

The commission consisted of four paintings, two in the arched spaces  beneath the small dome of the nave and two more in the same format  placed at the head of the aisles. The nave paintings represent the pious legend of the founding of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, the mother church of Santa María Blanca. According to this story, a Roman patrician, John, and his wife had pledged their wealth to the Virgin. She rewarded their piety by appearing in a dream and instructed them to build a church in her name on the Esquiline Hill, in accordance with a plan that would be traced on the surface of a miraculous summertime snowfall. The couple rushed to report their vision to Pope Liberius (352-366), who had also been visited by the Virgin, and all proceeded to the designated place, where they witnessed the miraculous fall of snow. Following the heaven-sent plan, they built the church and named it Santa Maria della Neve, the Italian word for \"snow,\" which coincides with the name of the Sevillian canon, Justino de Neve (1625-1685), who was one of Murillo's principal patrons and who commissioned the redecoration of the Santa María Blanca, originally a synagogue and later converted into a church.

This was not Napoleon the athletic and heroic warrior, but Napoleon the statesman and lawgiver who, as the burnt-down candle and the clock with a time of 4-13 am show, works far into the night for the benefit of his subjects. A scroll of paper in the bureau bears the word 'Code\", which refers to the new Civil Code, actually in operation since 1804 but which was renamed the 'Code Napoleon' in 1807 in an obvious propaganda move to promote him as a legislator. In the portrait the emperor has evidently just stopped work and, as the sword on the chair indicates, now prepares to review the troops wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Foot Grenadier Guards.

        "description": "The painting is signed and dated: CLAVDE GILLE IVRI/ROMAE 1667. There are in all five painted versions of this subject by Claude dating from four different decades. The earliest is dated 1634 (Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum), followed by the second, dated 1647 (on loan to Utrecht, Centraal Museum), a third dated 1655 (Moscow, Pushkin Museum) and a fourth of 1658 (private collection). The version in the Royal Collection, dated 1667, is the last in the series and in many ways marks the climax of the artist's treatment of the theme. This is admirably reflected in its heightened poetic sensibility and the sophisticated level of technical skills. Of the various compositions, that of 1634 is also recorded in an etching, while the others are included in Claude's Liber Veritatis (LV 111, 136 and 144), which served as an official drawn record made by the artist himself of his painted compositions dating from 1637 onwards. While the basic features of the design and iconography were established in the Fort Worth painting, changes or differences in emphasis occur in the others as Claude modified his style. It is also true to say that the version in Utrecht served as the basis for the later renderings, particularly in the greater spaciousness of the setting. There is a closer compositional affinity, however, between the painting in Moscow and the present picture, although small alterations in scale and in the number of figures and animals are apparent. For the painting in the Royal Collection Claude most probably referred back to the drawing of the Moscow version made for the Liber Veritatis (LV 136), although the picture itself remained in Rome in the collection of Fabio Chigi (1599-1667), who was elected Pope as Alexander VII in 1655 and was one of the artist's most important patrons. There is circumstantial evidence in the form of an inscription made by a later hand on the back of the drawing (LV 136) that the painting in the Royal Collection was made for Philippe de Graveron. An autograph drawing dated 1670, not from the Liber Veritatis, after the present painting is in the British Museum, London. The source for the story of the Rape of Europa is Ovid's Metamorphoses (II, 833-75). Jupiter, enamoured with Europa, the daughter of Agenor, changes himself into a white bull and mingles with the herd of cattle on the seashore where Europa and her maidens linger. Attracted by the beauty of the bull and not aware of Jupiter's transformation, Europa climbs onto its back and is abducted, eventually being carried out to sea. The description in Ovid is immensely poetic and Claude, by this time well versed in mythology and fully practised in its depiction, successfully expresses the beauty of the text in paint. The mood of the picture is established principally by the chief compositional features of trees, coastline, vessels and fortification judiciously placed within the picture space. The wide spatial intervals create a feeling of calm while quicker rhythms required for the narrative are concentrated in the foreground. The tonal values help to create an atmosphere charged with poetic feeling while the soft breeze wafting from the water is almost palpable. The overall beauty of the painting is enhanced by a number of felicitous details, both in terms of colour and of observation, in which Claude's painting matches Ovid's poetry. The care lavished on the draperies, the flowers and garlands, the waves lapping the sides of the vessels, and the down along the flanks of the cattle testify to the precision of Claude's art in creating a world that oscillates between quotidian experience and arcadian bliss.",

        "description": "The narration of the story of Mary on the left wall of the chapel starts at the bottom at the entrance to the chapel with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple. In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family. This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle. In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Interestingly enough, there is a repetition of this façade, constructed shortly after Ghirlandaio's frescoes were painted, that can be seen when leaving the church of Santa Maria Novella at the other end of the piazza by the Spedale di San Paolo (built 1489 -1498). Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings. Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici. In the group at the right Ghirlandaio depicts famous contemporary artists (including himself) who can be identified from the description of Vasari as Alesso Baldovinetti, Bastiano Mainardi, Davide and Domenico Ghirlandaio.",

        "description": "Soon after returning to Haarlem from Italy, Van Heemskerck created his Triumphal Procession of Bacchus, a fascinating amalgam of the art seen in Italy woven into a novel composition. Inspired loosely by Roman sarcophagi and by engravings after Mantegna, the composition is a living frieze. The figures are packed into the foreground as they progress through a ruined triumphal arch towards the temple of Bacchus. Bacchus, the god of wine, can scarcely sit up. The satyr supporting him playfully tweaks his breast and, with tongue wagging, stares lustily at the viewer. Two children hold up a mirror so the viewer can see an inebriated man who, having lost all decorum, defecates. Despite such moralizations, Van Heemskerck's intention was to devise a bacchanal, a modern counterpart to the scenes described in Roman literature. He delighted in showing off his talents at rendering the human body in motion. Some celebrants stand or stride, other do somersaults and walk on stilts. The horn player in the foreground conveys the artist's knowledge of anatomy and contrapposto. The painting is a pastiche of Roman sources. The standing man on the right was inspired by the Apollo in the de Sassi's collection. Raphael's Triumph of Galatea in the Farnesina and Michelangelo's paintings provided the sources for several figures. Van Heemskerck borrowed from his own drawings of the portico ofOctavia for the colossal foot, of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli for the Temple of Bacchus behind, and of Michelangelo's Bacchus (now in the Bargello, Florence) which when in the Casa Galli was believed to be antique, for the cult statue within.",

        "description": "In 1564, Willibald Imhoff, the child from the first marriage of Johannes Kleberger's second wife, Felicita Pirckheimer (who had first married Hans Imhoff, acquired the painting in Lyon from Johannes's son, David Kleberger. In 1588, it was sold by Willibald's heirs to Emperor Rudolph II. From Prague, it went to the Schatzkammer in Vienna and, in 1748, to the gallery. Among the three portraits Dürer painted in 1526 - Hieronymus Holzschuher, Jakob Muffel, and Johannes Kleberger (1486-1546) - the last was distinct for the format of the frame and for the depiction: the man, in fact, is sketched in a bas relief, in a half-bust, and inserted, classically, in a clypeus. It is an unusual depiction among Dürer's works, which has largely puzzled art historians. But since portraits in bas-relief on medallions were often found on the facades of Renaissance buildings in France, where Kleberger lived for a long time, it is quite likely that the patron himself had requested the artist to portray him in this way. Dürer's innovation was that of vivifying the portrait in bas relief on a medallion of fake stone, giving him the colours of a live, if pale, complexion. Dürer takes up again the age-old theme of the comparison of the figurative arts, or, more specifically, the discussion of the predominance of one on the other. He interprets this discussion by presenting an image in sculpture, with its light and shadow, giving at the same time the signs of a painted portrait. Thus, even while maintaining, in the steadiness of the gaze, the immobile plasticity of a sculpted image, characteristic of the portraits of emperors during classical times, the result is a particularly vivid portrait, since it expresses the power of the subject and his extremely ambitious character. Johannes Kleberger, on the whole, had good reason to be proud of himself: working for the Imhoff merchants in Bern and especially in Lyon - a city that, because of its geographical position, had become a huge trading centre with branches of very important German merchants - he had accumulated a sizable wealth that allowed him, in 1522, to provide a loan for Francis I of France. During his sojourn in Nuremberg, in 1525-26, he had Dürer paint his portrait and, after having married the daughter of Willibald Pirckheimer, Felicita, the widow of Hans Imhoff, he returned to Lyon, where he acquired various properties. In 1543, Francis I appointed him his valet de chambre. Johannes Kleberger thus became one of the ten wealthiest and most influential inhabitants of Lyon. He gave enormous financial donations to the city, as in 1531 when, during the plague epidemic, he gave 500 livres to benefit the orphans of the plague victims. He was called le bon Allemand, and a monument was erected in his honour, of which a replica still exists today. Upon his death, along with the bequests to the hospitals in Bern and Geneva, he left the French city huge sums to assign to charities. Yet the portrait Dürer delivers shows a very hard-looking man: a hardness underscored from the classical type of pose and from the indication of the coldness of the stone. Behind the inscription (E[FFIGIES] IOAN[N]I KLEBERGERS NORICI AN[N]O AETA[TIS] SVAE XXXX) lies the cabalistic sign of the sol in corde leonis, which is the conjunction of the brightest star of Leo, with the sun that was taken from the De occulta philosophia of Agrippa von Nettesheim (1510). He, too, was a German whom Kleberger likely met in Lyon, and according to whom the men born under this sign were destined for greatness. The symbol also represents an amulet against melancholy. Even the symbol of Leo surrounded by stars, depicted in the upper-left corner of the painting, would have a divinatory significance and again, according to Agrippa von Nettesheim, it would represent the particularly fortunate position of the person portrayed. In the lower corners, to the left and right, are the redende Wappen (figurative coats of arms) of the Kleberger family.",

Among her exquisite items of jewellery she wears a drop-shaped brilliant in her hair that is held in place by a clip shaped like a black eagle.

It is one of those paintings that mislead the unprepared viewer by displaying the wall on which these objects have been hung.

Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings.

His peasant landscape contains certain Mannerist elements such as the large distance between the foreground objects and the sweeping horizon, or in the way in which he has united contrasts. The aspects of Bloemaert's work adopted by Dutch landscape painters are the picturesque elements evident in his rendering of nature and architecture. The picturesque appeal of dilapidated cottages, damaged thatching, broken fences and rotten tree trunks were to become part and parcel of Netherlandish landscape painting. Bloemaert's oeuvre also forges a link between Flemish and Dutch painting. While his portrayals of mythological themes and biblical tales lean heavily on the syntax of the international Flemish Mannerists, the dramatic realism of his rural genre paintings influenced the Dutch artists.",

        "description": "The story is taken from the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet Ovid. After Apollo had offended Cupid in his capacity as an archer, the god of love shot two separate arrows out of spite. One of these struck Apollo himself, who became inflamed with love for Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus. With the other, with opposing effect, he hit Daphne, who as a result fled Apollo's advances. Maratti depicts the point at which Apollo almost catches up Daphne and she is rescued by changing into an olive tree. In the foreground lies Peneus, recognisable as river god by his crock of flowing water. Carlo Maratti, a native of the Marches and a pupil of Andrea Sacchi, was one of the leading painters of the Rome of his day. The prestigious commission for this painting came from Louis XIV of France. In it the king consciously followed the image of the Sun King by selecting a theme with the sun god Apollo in the main role. The moment in the story chosen here is very traditional and well-loved in the pictorial arts. A famous and virtuoso model is Bernini's group in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. Even so, Maratti's work was rejected by the French court when his work arrived in 1681. The Académie that the king had founded, with its ideals of unity of place, time and action, reproached Maratti for depicting the river god Apianus in the background, although Ovid mentions only later in the story that this god lamented Daphne's lot together with Peneus. In accordance with the art theory of the time, which encouraged rivalry between artists, many French artists attempted to improve Maratti's composition by observing the academic rules in their own works with the same theme. In this way Maratti's painting became not only one of the first, but, ironically enough, also one of the most influential manifestations of classicism at the French court. Maratti's figures also contain various borrowings from classical antiquity and Renaissance models. His Apollo follows the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican. The nymph to Apianus' right strongly resembles a print by Marcantonio Raimondi based on Raphael. Later Ingres and Manet sought inspiration from similar sources for their Odalisque and Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe respectively.",

In keeping with the imperial claim of the inscription (in Latin on the tablet tied to the tree in this portrait: CAROLUS REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE - Charles King of Great Britain), the pose and woodland setting echo Titian's equestrian portrait of the Emperor Charles V at Muhlberg. (Titian's painting itself recalled the famous Roman bronze of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius on horseback.) Over his armour Charles wears a gold locket bearing the image of Saint George and the Dragon, the so-called Lesser George. He wore it constantly; it contained a portrait of his wife, and was with him the day he died. Here, however, it identifies him with the Order of the Garter of which Saint George was patron. As Garter Sovereign he is riding, like Charles V, at the head of his chivalrous knights in defence of the faith. In a profound sense the portrait is a visual assertion of Charles's claim to Divine Kingship. Albeit high above our heads - the horizon line ensures that our viewpoint is roughly at the level of his stirrup - his face is undistorted by foreshortening. Van Dyck's three-quarter view refines his features, and he bestrides his horse with a remote air of noble contemplation.",

Elegant hunting scenes appealed to aristocratic art collectors who were able to identify with them and saw their rank and prestige reflected in them. With a number of variations in subject matter, it was possible to cater for a great diversity of tastes. Setting Out on the Hunt, and its pendant, also in Dresden, number among Wouwerman's later works. They date from a period in which his attention was chiefly devoted to hunting scenes. Indeed, about two hundred paintings on this theme are known from his hand. In this painting the horses have been saddled and the hounds are waiting in front of a grand country house for the chase to begin. The scene is aristocratic in character, as can be seen not only from the noble villa, but also from the sculptures adorning the buildings, the Baroque fountain, and the elegance of the hunting party. Wouwerman introduces a touch of genre painting into the work by placing a mother with two children squatting on the ground and a beggar asking for alms to the left of the picture. The elegant subject matter, the expansive southern landscape, the horses caught most faithfully in their movements, the depictions of figures with loving attention to detail, and the sensitive use of colour are all typical of Wouwerman's late period.",

Brandi gained a reputation as an artist who was able to bring together the classicist style with baroque figurative inventions and above all the light of Caravaggio, something he was aware of through the paintings of Mattia Preti. In fact, Brandi's style is marked by the potent effect of colours amid shadows, colour that in some cases was all too strong.

        "description": "Mercury and Herse, which was formerly attributed to Adam Elsheimer, is a testimony to the great success enjoyed by a painting, now lost, of the same subject by the German master. The painting was admired by members of the group of Italianised painters in Rome, one of whom was the Dutch artist Jacob Pynas, to whom the authorship of this work on copper has now been credited. The story is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses (II, 708-729) which conveniently allowed artists to combine a classical literary source with landscape painting. Mercury, who has just punished the shepherd Battus for disloyalty, is flying over the farmlands and woods of Attica when he spots a procession of young girls wending their way to the sanctuary of Minerva. Conspicuous in the procession for her beauty is one of the daughters of Cecrops, Herse; the sight of her arouses instant passion in the god, who descends to earth in the hope of encountering her. The story ends with the transformation of the envious Aglauros, Herse's sister, into stone. For his painting Elsheimer chose the moment when Mercury espied Herse for the first time, which gave him the opportunity to paint an aerial landscape with a procession of young girls winding through it. Elsheimer's lead was followed by Paul Bril in a small painting on copper (Devonshire collection, Chatsworth), by Cornelis van Poelenburch in his youthful painting (Mauritshuis, The Hague) and by Hermann van Swanevelt, who also used the subject in the late 1630s for a painting on canvas (Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome). Jacob Pynas's painting fits into this popular context. His interpretation of the landscape, particularly the feathered leaves of the trees, the atmospheric depth and the presence of a small classical temple in the background, seems dependent on the brilliant prototypes mentioned above which date between 1610 and 1615. In particular, the balanced composition, combined with an intense softness in the painting of the natural elements, seems to be a stylistic reference to the mature work of Bril. This could provide further confirmation of the new chronology of Jacob Pynas's stay in Rome, recently altered from 1605-08 to around 1617/18, when his elder brother Jan enjoyed a second sojourn in Italy. This painting is therefore probably more or less contemporary with one of the few works signed and dated by Jacob, his Mercury and Battus (Wiener collection, New York) of 1618.",

        "description": "In 1518 a new project brought together three Sienese painters, Sodoma, Beccafumi and Girolamo del Pacchia. The new project was a scheme of fresco paintings to embellish the interior of a meeting room belonging to one of the city's oldest confraternities - the Confraternity of Santa Maria degli Angeli della Veste Nera (Saint Mary of the Angels and of the Black Robes). Founded in honour of the Virgin after 1450 the confraternity also adopted Bernardino as one of their saints, adding his name to the confraternity's title. For this reason the room that painters decorated is now known as the Oratory of San Bernardino. Designed as a place where the members of the confraternity would meet to conduct both their collective devotions and their administrative business, the Oratory of San Bernardino offers a rare example of an early sixteenth-century decorative ensemble that has survived in almost its original form. On the side walls of the room there is a series of large-scale fresco paintings separated from one another by pilasters decorated with candelabra motifs. The paintings consist of narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin. Sodoma had been assigned the paintings of the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation. In his painting of the Presentation, Sodoma introduced many of the lavishly attired bystanders that are characteristic of his Monteoliveto frescoes. The architectural setting for the scene, however, appears to have been influenced by Raphael's fresco of the Expulsion of Heliodorus (1512) in the Stanza d'Eliodoro in the Vatican. The paintings depicts two sets of marble colonnades seen in sharp recession, thus providing a framework and focus for an important event taking place at some distance from the spectator. In the case of the confraternity painting, this is the crucial encounter between the young child and the High Priest at the high altar, which forms the focal point of the story of the Virgin's presentation in the Temple.",

As a decorative artist, Boucher had amazing facility; in this painting, done for the Salon in 1742, he wished to excel himself. It places him in the ranks of the great masters, and on looking at it one begins to realize how gifted he was, even though he did not always make full use of his talent. The slender nudes and the hunting theme recall the School of Fontainebleau, of which certain traditions persist in the eighteenth century. The paint surface is intact, and the old varnish, which contains no artificial colouring, gives it a slightly golden tone. The painting is a masterpiece in the true classical manner; the technique is not too obvious, all the values are harmoniously balanced, and the elegance of the drawing and the purity of the forms are more important than the more sensual charms of colour.",

        "description": "This small, finely executed painting is a good example of Hubert Robert's refined art. Robert, a French painter of the second half of the 18th century, is known mainly for his landscapes decorated with imaginary architecture and little figures, in which happiness, reality and fiction, archaeological taste and sense of decoration are all mingled. Avenue in a Park is a late work in the painter's career, testifying to the permanence of his style and to his taste for a nature that has been disciplined and made decorative by man. The subject matter still reflects the \"douceur de vivre\" so dear to the 18th century. An avenue lined with trees with their tops intertwined leads the spectator towards the bottom of the garden. In the centre, a young girl is playing on a swing, activated by two companions. A group of people to the right are looking on. The whole painting bathes in a soft harmony of browns, greys and greens against a bluish sky background. The red coat of the man leaning against the pedestal catches the viewer's eye. The antique statues - reposing satyr and faun playing a flute - flanking the tree-lined opening in the foreground had been earlier captured by Robert in a red chalk drawing of various Graeco-Roman sculptures conserved in the Capitol (Valence, Musée des Beaux Arts). The artist has repeated them here the other way round. The young musician in turn had appeared in several of Robert's paintings. Arriving in Rome in 1754, Robert stayed there for over 10 years. It is there that he met the Abbé de Saint-Non, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and in particular Gian Paolo Panini, who was to have a lasting influence on him. He also became friends with Fragonard. The little painting in Brussels confirms the close links between the art of \"Robert of the Ruins\" and Fragonard's poetic universe. The avenue of trees also refers to the many parks and gardens in Italy and the Ile-de-France which were to nourish his imagination throughout his long and successful career. Robert exhibited at every salon from 1767 to 1798, becoming \"designer of the King's gardens\" in 1777 and much later, after the revolutionary tumult, producing plans for converting the Grande Galerie of the Louvre into a museum.",

Dürer and northern figurative culture in general were also behind the most striking characteristics of the canvas, the close adherence to an everyday reality that has frequently induced authoritive scholars of Pontormo to interpret this extraordinary work as heralding the realistic research of Caravaggio, Velázquez and Zurbarán. The elimination of the distance between painted event and spectator and the foreshortened contact with reality are effects created by the inclusion of portraits of people living at the time and participating in the event, and the large naked feet of the disciples in the lower part of the painting, where the heads of cats can be seen, their inquisitive gazes directed towards the onlooker. A crouching puppy can just be seen in the lower left corner of the painting.

The leading exponents of this period were van Dyck and Lely. This portrait of Henrietta Maria, Queen of England is an idealized portrait. Henrietta Maria of France (1609-1669), the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de Médici, was the Queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of two kings, Charles II and James II and grandmother of two queens and one king, Mary II, William III and Anne of Great Britain as well as paternal aunt of Louis XIV of France. She had married Charles I in 1625, but soon fell out of favour with Parliament and the people because of her support for English Catholics. Later, she tried in vain and with great personal commitment, to help her husband. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, she settled in Paris. In 1660, when her oldest son succeeded to the throne as Charles II of Great Britain and Ireland, Henrietta Maria returned to England where she lived as Dowager Queen and Queen Mother until 1665 when she returned permanently to France. She died at the age of 59 at the château de Colombes, near Paris, marking the end of a turbulent life. She was buried in the French royal necropolis at the Basilica of St Denis. Lely portrays her here as a beautiful and dignified woman in royal dress with an expression of suffering on her lips and a look of aloof mourning in her eyes. This is no longer a Baroque representative portrait, but tends far more in the direction of an individual interpretative portrayal. The nature of her life's journey is hidden by her reserved facial expression.",

Among the first to respond were the Schoolmasters and the Soap-boilers, who shared an altar in the church. They contracted Frans Francken to paint a triptych showing Jesus among the Doctors. (The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.) The scenes plainly have most to do with the schoolmasters. The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem. His parents, who have found him after a long search, look somewhat dejected. The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background. The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild. The only reference to the Soap-boilers is in the right wing, where the Bible story of the Miracle of the Flowing Oil is depicted. The prophet Elisha helped the widow of Zarephath out of debt by causing her oil jug to continuously replenish itself - an appropriate theme, for oil was one of the ingredients used by the soap-boilers. The style of the triptych is sober and didactic, as befits the schoolmasters, if not the soapmakers. The balanced composition with its symmetrically arranged groups and the restrained presentation of the principal theme, without many secondary scenes or symbols, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, the latest artistic trend at the time.",

With his characteristic objectivity and painstaking technique, Mor depicts Pejerón dressed as a courtier with a black doublet and cap, white breeches and hose, slashed shoes and a sword at his waist. Pero Hernández de la Cruz, Perejón, a servant of the Count of Benavente, enjoyed the favour of the future Philip II, taking part in many of the festivities organised by him and receiving suits of clothes and costly gifts from as early as 1544. Married and with children, Perejón owned several houses in Benavente from where Prince Philip - en route to England to marry Mary Tudor - and his son Don Carlos saw five bulls in the ring in 1554 and attended the baptism of Perejón's son, whose godfather was the Duke of Alba.",

In style it falls between the sparseness of The Annunciation in cell 3 and the richness of the Cortona altarpiece. Unlike in the Cortona version, the garden is here viewed through a colonnade of columns which recede to a vanishing point near the centre of the painting. Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. It is the theme of the tabernacles which multiply themselves at the crossing of the ways; the greeting taken from the mediaeval hymnology and the invitation addressed to the passer-by and writings under the painting show Angelico's most cultivated devotion: Salve, Mater pietatis / et totius Trinitatis / nobile triclinium / Maria!

The same colour tone and mood as in the Apotheosis, but used in a much more self-assured perspective composition, appears again in the Meeting between Pope Cyriacus and the Pilgrims. Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490. The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls.",

        "description": "Single detached religious paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger are relatively rare in his oeuvre. However, having been trained by his father in Augsburg, Holbein did produce two large altarpieces during the early part of his career: the Oberried altarpiece of about 1520 (Münster, Freiburg-im-Breisgau) and the Passion altarpiece of about 1524 (Basel, Öffentliche Kunstsammlung), both designed in the traditional Gothic style with several compartments. The `Noli me Tangere' is comparable with The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb dated 1522 (Basel, Öffentliche Kunstsammlung) to which it is close in date and in its own way no less dramatic. The foreground is dominated by the two principal figures who surprise one another in front of the tomb depicted on the right. Behind in the middle distance are two disciples, Saint Peter and Saint John, making their way to Jerusalem which can be espied in the valley below. On the left is Calvary where, unusually, the artist has shown more than three crosses. The scene is carefully composed, with the verticals established by the risen Christ and Mary Magdalen continued by the trees. The dialogue between the main figures is echoed by the poses of the two disciples, whose forms are contained in the space between the chief protagonists. As the disciples hurry away so they lead the eye down the hill and over the distant landscape. The fluid handling of the paint (some changes are visible around the door of the tomb and to the outlines of the Magdalen) and the firm drawing of the figures are characteristic of the younger Holbein, as is the precision with which the green sward in the foreground is rendered. Other features though, such as the sombre colours, the distinctive faces with high foreheads, long noses and small chins, the fast moving clouds seen between the trees, and the luminous interior of the tomb reveal the residual influence of the elder Holbein, as well as of Hans Baldung Grien and Hans Burgkmair. The painting may well have been made in 1524, the year of Holbein's visit to France, or shortly afterwards. Rowlands contends that the Magdalen is dressed in the French fashion and that the ointment jar is recognisable as French faience. In addition, he argues that Holbein shows some knowledge of the style of Leonardo da Vinci and his followers, whose works were represented in the collection of Francis I at Amboise and Blois. Other works by Holbein of similar date (The Last Supper, Venus and Cupid, Lais of Corinth - all in Basel, Öffentliche Kunstsammlung) reveal Leonardesque elements which in the present painting are most evident in the tension between Christ and Mary Magdalen, the fluency of their movements, and in the treatment of the landscape seen from above. It may be added that the face of the Magdalen is particularly reminiscent of the types painted by Andrea Solario, a follower of Leonardo da Vinci who worked in France from around 1507-11 (compare, for example, Solario's Salome with the Head of Saint john the Baptist - New York, Metropolitan Museum). On the other hand, it has been suggested on the evidence of the oak panel (oak was uncommon in France) that the painting was undertaken in Antwerp in 1526 as Holbein travelled to England. However, there is some corroborative evidence that the painting was executed in France. The picture was not recorded in the Royal Collection until it was seen by John Evelyn in 1680 at Whitehall Palace. Yet it may be identifiable with a picture that hung in the bedroom of Henrietta Maria while in exile at Colombes until her death in 1669, when Charles II would seem to have acquired it. This implies that the painting could have remained in France since the sixteenth century.",

The artist produced two versions the earlier of which is now in the Pinacoteca, the second is still over a side altar on the south wall of the church of San Niccolò al Carmine, but without its original predella. The earlier of these two versions of the expulsion of the rebel angels from heaven by the Archangel Michael is at first sight difficult to read: the lower part of the painting is dominated by the tall, elongated figures of three standing nude men. It requires some effort to discern that, within the gloom that surrounds them, other figures are shown in convoluted poses. In the upper part of the painting, encircled by a swirling mass of flying angels, is the arresting figure of Saint Michael. Clad in fanciful antique armour, he holds his sword aloft as a sign of his victory over the vanquished rebel angels. Above him in turn appears an extraordinarily daring representation of God, portrayed in extreme foreshortening. As the deity presiding over this act of heavenly vengeance, he appears as an insubstantial - but certainly visionary - phenomenon. The second version, by comparison, is much more clearly organised. Here God appears as a monumental figure, seated in jjudgment. The bright red of his voluminous mantle and the golden hemisphere behind him ensure that this figure dominates the composition as a whole. The angelic company is organised into an orderly choir of seated figures surrounding God, with only a few of their companions engaged in expelling the rebel angels. Saint Michael has been placed much lower in the composition and acts as the principal agent between heaven and hell. Although still holding a sword above his head, he has been divested of armour and appears in a pale pink and golden yellow tunic, tied across the chest with pale blue ribbons. Beneath him, the fallen angels recline in a series of subterranean vaults lit by sulphurous light. The devil has been transformed into a snarling monstrous beast that has the appearance of a classical chimaera.",

Then he arrived to Budapest and spent two weeks in Kalocsa in the residence of Lajos Haynald, archbishop, a sponsor of ecclesiastical art and a  friend of Franz Liszt. Munkácsy must have had the idea of painting the trilogy by then. He started to study the works of Rembrandt and Rubens and after thirty-five studies and sketches in oil, he painted the first composition sketch at the Easter of 1880. The picture was introduced to Karl Sedelmeyer, his sponsor, in Sedelmeyer's palace in Paris. The success which followed the exhibitions in Vienna, Budapest and more than twenty towns in Great Britain was enormous. Sedelmeyer completed the exhibition with sketches, studies, books and cuts. He took the picture to America in November 1886. Munkácsy spent six weeks in New York, Philadelphia and Washington and painted portraits. John Wanamaker, a millionaire, bought the pictures \"Christ before Pilate\" and \"Golgotha\" for 120,000 and 100,000 dollars, respectively, in 1887, although some sources claimed  that the prices he payed were 175,000 and 160,000 dollars, respectively. Both pictures were borrowed to the World Exhibiton in Paris in 1889 and Wanamaker took them himself to the Chicago Exhibition in 1893. The two pictures were kept in the gallery of his country residence until 1907. When a fire broke out there, the pictures were removed and restored. In 1911-88 the two pictures faced each other in the gallery of  the Wanamaker-store on the 8th floor together with pictures by other painters. At the Sotheby's auction in 1988 there was a Canadian man bidding for the picture on the telephone and who bought it in the end. It turned out later that it was Joseph T. Tanenbaum. The picture arrived in Debrecen on 2nd February 1995. After restoration by Miklós Szentkirályi, István Lente and Erzsébet Béres in the spring of 1995, it was exhibited in Hungary on 25th August 1995, 113 years after its first exhibition in Hungary. This was in fact the first time that the complete Christ trilogy was exhibited. Although the enormous trilogy  relies on the words of the Bible (John 18 and 19, and Luke 23), yet it condenses them as well. The picture shows a victorious Christ who is standing in the middle with a radiant whiteness and defeats his spiteful enemies and the hesitating Roman governor. Several contemporary artists (Ivanov, Antokolski, and Gustave Doré) were engaged in the subject matter of the \"passion\", but Munkácsy's work is second to none. He did not only prove that he knew the Bible, but he demonstrated his psychological skills, that he knew his age and himself, too. He went through the biblical events in a changing age full of doubts and he used it as an excuse to express his thoughts on and disappointment in the world and ethic.",

On the left bank of the river is a village and a Late Gothic church of a type common in Holland. On the right bank, a boat with lowered sails is moored by a farmhouse. The sailboat in the foreground, flying the Dutch flag, is a 'schouw', one of a few types of shallow-draft vessel that were used to ship goods and occasionally passengers between towns on the inland waterways.

His brother is intent on observing the large number of arrows or fatal darts of love (a metaphor for amorous glances) the nymph is carrying. This entire painting is covered by a unified golden red shade that is particularly apparent in the colour of the sky. The colour scheme is completed by an economical use of blues and greens. Titian decided not to use the powerful, impasto highlights that are such a frequent feature of his works during the 1550s. The painting, in spite of the potentially joyous mythological subject and similarly to other works executed in this period, is pervaded with a degree of tension which is clearly evident in the sad and pensive expressions and in the intense colours of the fiery sky. The rapid brush-strokes of Titian's mature pictorial technique when seen close to seem to break up the forms but from a distance they acquire an extraordinary modelled quality and create a chromatic texture that blends the background and figures in a `Venetian' harmony of colours. In the 17th century this style influenced Velázquez, Rubens, van Dyck and Caravaggio.",

        "description": "This painting depicts one of the many events surrounding Alexander the Great's defeat of the Persian Emperor Darius in 330 BCE, which was one of the most popular narratives in 18th-century art. The motif held special interest for Francesco Fontebasso and his contemporaries for two reasons. First, the representation of people's varied reactions to Alexander's presence allowed for a systematic study of expression. Secondly, the historic subject was a favorite among their aristocratic patrons. It is believed that Family of Darius Before Alexander may have been one of a series of works which were executed to decorate the interior of the Palazzo Pola in Treviso. Fontebasso chose to depict the interactions after the battle, when Alexander and Hephaestion visit Darius's imprisoned mother and wife. Based on the two men's similarly regal attire, the women mistook the latter for Alexander. Hephaestion gestures toward Alexander, attempting to end the confusion. Darius's wife is terribly moved by the sight of her husband's great enemy and is wiping her tears, while the two daughters and son look more interested than frightened. This encounter had previously been depicted by several famed Venetian artists. The Renaissance painter Paulo Veronese produced his interpretation of this scene nearly two centuries prior to Fontebasso's version, but several features of the work suggest a close emulation of the elder's example. The composition and specific moment may have been familiar to Fontebasso through the famed images of Alexander with Darius's family created by Sebastiano Ricci and Giavanni Battista Tiepolo. All of these artists included a young boy holding a shield on the lower right and the bowing figure of the queen to the left of her husband's foes. Rather than Veronese's crisp, linear, architectural setting, Ricci and Fontebasso both placed the figures in a tented environment of colorful, textured fabrics. Family of Darius before Alexander, is an excellent example of the Venetian Rococo style. Fontebasso's utilization of bold draughtsmanship and broad painting technique, with its thick impasto, give the painting its freshness, intensity, and vigor. The decorative scene seems to be taking place on stage and speaks of the exuberance and drama of the age. Like the work of Tiepolo, the painting is executed in the \"Grand Manner,\" and unity is given to the composition by an intense, brilliant light which illuminates the entire surface of the work.",

        "description": "This painting belongs to a narrative cycle depicting scenes from the life of Catherine of Siena, a fourteenth-century Dominican saint, who was a minister to the poor as well as a mystic. The panels, based on a biography of Saint Catherine written in 1385 by her confessor Raymond of Capua, represent the first complete pictorial cycle of her life. This series may have been produced following St Catherine's canonization in 1461 and added as a predella (base) to a preexisting altarpiece. Catherine Benincasa was born in Siena about 1347, died in 1380, and was canonized in 1461. She was a member of the Dominican order, a mystic, and minister to the poor and plague-stricken. This picture illustrates St Catherine's miraculous levitation and exchange of her bloody heart with Christ. These miracles are recounted in his biography of Catherine by her confessor, Raymond of Capua; however, Raymond describes them as three separate episodes. In one, Christ takes Catherine's heart. In another, in the church of San Domenico in Siena, Christ appears and places his heart in her side. Raymond then describes her levitations, during which Catherine \"contemplated the marvels of God.\" Giovanni di Paolo did not follow any of these accounts specifically. Rather he combined them, emphasizing their mystic nature by congesting the space with three ecclesiastical buildings. The small church alongside which Catherine levitates has an open door, above which is a figure of Christ as the Man of Sorrows - a poignant contrast to his appearance to Catherine, his hand raised in blessing while she holds a bleeding heart.",

The impression is sought of vast panoramic vistas, which are seen not from a natural but from an artificially high viewpoint.

According to classical tradition, Charon, the boatman carried the souls of those entering Tartarus or Hades across the River Styx in his boat. In this painting the artist constructed a deep vista of a river and its two banks. Because of the bird's-eye view and horizontal picture format, the world seems to unfold beneath us.

In response to the French pointillist style, Ensor used palette knives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colours with expressive freedom. Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer - a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, and caricatures. Public, historical, and allegorical figures, along with the artist's family and friends, make up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the centre of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functions as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed - a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littré, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton and leading on the eager, mindless crowd. Above the crowd is a political banner bearing the legend Vive la Sociale ('Long live the Welfare State'); the implication is that Christ's message, like Ensor's, is not being heeded. Parody becomes a nightmare when one notices, lurking among the masks on the left foreground, the figure of Death in a top hat. After rejection by Les XX, the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929. Ensor displayed Christ's Entry prominently in his home and studio throughout his life. With its aggressive, painterly style and merging of the public with the deeply personal, Christ's Entry was a forerunner of twentieth-century Expressionism. The painting is signed and dated lower right, beneath the elevated platform: \"J. ENSOR / 1888\".",

Aachen gives the mythological figures the facial features of his family: his own, his wife and their son. The motif could allude to the famous picture of the Greek painter Zeuxis. He painted a boy with grapes so naturally that the birds pecked at the painted fruits.

This was certainly his favourite among the many paintings exhibiting her undeniable charms. At all events, he refused to part with Het Pelsken. In tones worthy of Titian, he painted Helene with curly hair, her nipples erect, her nudity barely concealed by a fur wrap better suited to her husband's bulk than her own. Her expression is difficult to read: is her mutinous air intended as a provocation, or was she simply anxious to wrap herself up against the cold? Nudity as an attribute of mythological beauty, which provided its \"justification\", was by no means new, but for Rubens the unusual picture of the naked Helene is exclusively private in character. Helene is standing on a red cloth and is wrapping herself, apparently spontaneously with a white cloth and a fur cloak. She is holding both in such a way that each arm crosses in front of her body covering the pelvic region, but pushing her breasts up in the crook of her right arm. Here, together with the face, the intimate gaze of the painter is betrayed. The title Het Pelsken (\"The Little Fur\") is due to Rubens himself, who described the painting thus in his will. He bequeathed it as a separate item to his wife and also stipulated expressly that it should not be offset against her official share of his estate. It was only after her death in 1658 that it passed into other hands.",

I have chosen a young woman of good but bourgeois family, though everyone sought to convince me to make a court marriage. But I was fearful of a vice inbred in the nobility, and especially prevalent among noble women: vanity. So I chose someone who would never have to blush at finding me brush in hand. And the truth is, I am too fond of my freedom to exchange it for the embraces of an old woman.\" Far from blushing, Helene was to inspire some of the most personal and moving of all Rubens' portraits.",

The two paintings were separated at the end of the eighteenth century. Guercino's increasing tendency towards classicism began in the 1630's when the painter fell under the influence of the late work of Guido Reni. Like its pendant, the Saul Attacking David is a splendid example of his late style, a period in which Guercino brought his investigations into classicising style to their fullest conclusion. Despite the dramatic quality of the narrative, the composition of the painting is extremely balanced: everything centres on the monumentality of the two figures, contrasting protagonists of the scene. Almost frozen in their action, they are displayed entirely in the foreground, as if in a relief sculpture. The chromatic range, light and highly refined, is rather far from the richly impasted mode of the artist's youth, as is the way in which the shadows ably underline the plastic quality of the two personages.",

        "description": "The painting shows the most dramatic moment of the Last Supper, when Jesus reveals to the disquieted apostles that one of them would betray him. Beside Christ, St John rests his head on the table and sleeps, in keeping with an iconographic tradition popular in Emilia. Meanwhile Peter, to the left of Christ, raises his hands in a gesture of astonishment. In the left foreground, Judas can be seen holding a purse behind his back: this contains thirty coins, the price of his treachery. The painting is one of the masterpieces of Valentin's maturity. His compositional scheme shows classical influence, with the solemn and monumental figure of Christ at the exact centre of the scene and the symmetric composition around him, with the apostles distributed regularly around the table. Such stylistic elements are distant from the convulsed and turbulent compositions Valentin had preferred earlier in his career. In contrast to these, which constitute a large part of Valentin's production, this picture reveals an attachment to the classicising French modes that Poussin and Vouet were developing in these years. Yet Caravaggesque style, an essential component of this painting, is perfectly evident in the realism of the apostles' hands, which Valentin depicts without any sort of idealization. The influence of Caravaggio also shows in the masterful control of light which, through the deft play of chiaroscuro, aptly emphasizes the emotional state of the characters. Likewise, light enlivens the simple but effective still life that seems to spring forth from the white tablecloth.",

        "description": "The picture shows a view looking toward the altar wall and the north wall with scenes 1-5 of the St Cecilia cycle. The cycle begins to the left of the altar. St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring. The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms. The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves. The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project. Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia. The scenes of the cycle are the following:  Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia) Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder) Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section) Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section) Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini) Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini) Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)  Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section) Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder) Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia)",

Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple. Vertumnus is a composite figure who represents various moments in time and historical elements in his various parts. His face is that of an old man, only the bonnet identifies him as an old woman. The feet and hands are those of a young person. This makes his transformation visible. The motif of his gait, due to which his garments are still fluttering, shows that he has just arrived. At the point where his right wrist is bent, the grapevine is entwined around the elm. The gentle touch of her shoulder with his youthful hand depicts the moment at which he reveals himself to her. Pomona's eyes are still lowered longingly while he is already gazing at her passionately. Until very recently the attribution of the painting was debated. In 1995 the existence of a documented signature by Melzi was proven, which an art dealer removed in the 18th century in order to be able to sell the picture as a work of Leonardo. Due to its poor condition, the painting was not taken seriously for a long time. It was only once it was restored that its similarity to Leonardo's works became evident.",

Paret lived in Bilbao from 1779 to 1786, years of prolific activity during which he was commissioned by king Charles III to paint views of the ports of the bay of Biscay, a series that includes this composition.

Less obvious is the identity of the bridegroom; he may be the man in black, with his back to the spectator, leaning back on his stool, mug in hand, calling for more wine. The feast is taking place in the barn, the wall behind the guests consisting of stacked-up straw or corn. Two ears of corn with a rake call to the mind work that harvesting involves. The plates are being carried around on a door taken off its hinges. The principal form of nourishment in those day consisted of bread, porridge and soup. A curious detail of the scene which has never been satisfactorily explained is the presence on the far right of a richly-dressed nobleman in earnest conversation with a monk.

        "description": "This tale from the life of St Peter is recorded in the collection of legends written down by Jacobus a Voragine in the 13th century. It tells how the apostle, having triumphed over Simon Magus, was persuaded by the Christians of Rome to leave town. Jacobus a Voragine relates how Peter encountered Christ on the Appian way and asked \"Quo vadis domine\" (Whither goest thou, master?), to which Christ replied \"To Rome, to be crucified anew.\" This apocryphal legend is in fact the beginning of Peter's own martyrdom. This would certainly explain the vigorous movements in Carracci's painting, with the apostle recoiling in terror. It is not the unexpected encounter with the risen Christ that has taken the apostle aback, but his awareness of his own human frailty. Annibale's magnificent rhetoric reminds the spectator of Christ's call to turn back. The viewer is on the Appian Way with Peter, or rather, is Peter meeting Christ. The foot of the cross protrudes from the panel, Christ's hand points outwards, and the shadows he casts attest to his corporeality as he strides toward us. While Peter's left foot remained in place, the rest of the figure was altered during painting, drawn back to the right edge of the panel in an attitude half-way between terror and obeisance, more deeply felt than his earlier pose but also making room for our implied presence. Firm contours delimit Christ's athletic bo,dy, yet its internal modelling is subtly lifelike, rippling with the movement of muscles and the angle at which surfaces catch the light. It is obvious that this figure was based on a live model, for his hands and lower legs are more sunburnt than his torso and thighs, although the face he turns to Peter is an idealised mask of pathos under the crown of thorns. Despite the dual sources of light from the background and in the foreground, the same sun seems to warm sky, trees, fields and Roman temples, and the crimson, white, gold and blue draperies, the metal keys, the youthful and the aged flesh and the chestnut and grizzled hair of the two wayfarers at the crossroads between time and eternity.",

Lot and his family were allowed to leave the city on condition that they did not look back. Lot's wife disobeyed the instruction and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot continued on with his daughters. Since their husbands had not fled with them, the daughters said to each other: \"Our father is old and there is not a man in the country to come to us in the usual way. Come now, let us make our father drink wine and then lie with him and in this way keep the family alive through our father.\" The sons born of this union subsequently founded the tribes of the Moabites and the Ammonites. Both as a strongly erotic group painting and as a history painting, the subject was a popular one in the 16th and 17th century. This painting, whose attribution to van Leyden - said to have executed his first commission at the age of twelve - is not altogether certain, falls into the second category. Alongside the group in the foreground, the destruction of Sodom seen in the left-hand background establishes a second point of focus. Influenced by Patenier, the painter portrays a kind of \"global landscape\" extending from the front left-hand corner into the depths of the composition. He thereby devotes particular care to the execution of the landscape details. The Louvre catalogue attributes this work to an unknown Netherlandish painter.",

Whereas, until then, there had only been occasional cases of \"pure\" object paintings one by Carpaccio, a hunting trophy by Barbari and a message (1506) about one Antonio da Crevalcore, who is said to have made a \"painting full of fruit\" - from Caravaggio onwards, still-life was to be the most popular of genres.

Caravaggio compensated for the apparent loss of contentual gravity in an astonishing way. The basket is at eye level and juts out over the edge of the table into the real space of the spectator. In this formal exaggeration and with a viewpoint liberated from all attributive connotations, the otherwise trivial object takes on an unheard of monumentality that renders the secret lives of objects, the play of light on their surfaces and the variety of their textures worthy of such painting.",

While Mary sat at his feet to listen to his words, Martha busied herself with work in the kitchen; eventually, she came to him and said: \"Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me.\" To which Christ replied, \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; but one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\" (St Luke 10:40-42). The composition of the painting, with a kitchen scene in the tradition of the \"bodegones\" taking up the foreground, while the scene involving Christ is presented as a view or a mirror image, is clearly influenced by the art of the Netherlands. Even the plump, ruddy-cheeked figure of Martha and the still-life arrangement of fish, garlic, eggs and paprika, recall examples of Northern European art. Moreover, this picture is charged with a strange sense of tension and restlessness. The events reflected in the mirror, bathed in a mild light and exuding an atmosphere peace and calm, are contrasted with the foreground image of loud and busy work. Through highlighting and formal diversity, the artist sets a scene that is clearly dissatisfactory to Martha. She is not concentrating on her work, but gazes full of yearning, on the verge of tears, and slightly angrily, as though she already realized that Mary had chosen the better part.",

This portrait captures the rich heiress at a pivotal moment in her life: the year of her second marriage to Montagu Bertie. She wears a black over-gown with a bodice and skirt of embroidered oyster silk, tied with striped ribbon at the waist. This ribbon also keeps in place the paned and padded figure-of-eight sleeves known as 'virago' sleeves. As a truly fashionable English beauty, Martha has taken as much care in choosing her accessories as she did her dress; the large double-collar, the feathers in her hair, and a black ostrich feather fan completing her costume. She stands by a chair under a red canopy, and the landscape beyond shows a withered tree stump, perhaps a symbolic reference to her recently deceased first husband and their childless marriage.",

        "description": "Born in Rotterdam in 1469, Desiderius Erasmus was the greatest European scholar of the 16th century. Using the philological methods pioneered by Italian humanists, he helped lay the groundwork for the historical-critical study of the past, especially in his studies of the Greek New Testament and the Church Fathers. His educational writings contributed to the replacement of the older scholastic curriculum by the new humanist emphasis on the classics. By criticizing ecclesiastical abuses, while pointing to a better age in the distant past, he encouraged the growing urge for reform, which found expression both in the Protestant Reformation and in the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Finally, his independent stance in an age of fierce confessional controversy - rejecting both Luther's doctrine of predestination and the powers that were claimed for the papacy - made him a target of suspicion for loyal partisans on both sides and a beacon for those who valued liberty more than orthodoxy. The painting shows Erasmus writing the first lines of his \"Comments on the Gospel of St Luke\" dated 1523. The lines are not legible on this painting but it is legible on another smaller version of the portrait in the museum of Basel. As in the Basel portrait, Holbein here depicts Erasmus as the learned author actively pursuing his vocation as a writer - his gaze is lowered and he focuses entirely on the text he is writing. Even though the scholar's study chambers is not shown, the tapestry with its pattern of plants and fabulous beasts and the wooden paneling explicitly indicate, unlike the background of the Basel version, that this is an interior. Holbein's greatness is demonstrated in this fine portrait not only in its technical mastery but also in its comprehension and presentation of the salient features of the subject's personality and activity. The scale of Erasmus' bulk within the picture space is prodigious; previously, scholars had been portrayed in book-lined studies, surrounded by the tools of their trade, musing as does Saint Jerome in Dürer's woodcut of 1514, complete with shaggy lion. (Erasmus himself edited Saint Jerome's works, thus identifying with the patron saint of translators.) Saint Augustine was also popularly depicted in a monastic study, as in Carpaccio's appealing image of 1505. Holbein's treatment is more intimate; to be able to look over the scholar's shoulder at the pen poised on the paper (engaged on the Paraphrase of Saint Mark) is an honour the nervous Erasmus would have granted only to intellectual equals. It has been concluded that Sir Thomas More was the intended recipient of this version: Erasmus was usually posed in a more formal three-quarter view. Such portraits were often exchanged by humanists as tokens of mutual esteem, which explains the considerable number of painted and engraved copies in existence; aspiring scholars would use these to adorn their studies as encouragement to their emulatory efforts. Erasmus lived through writing and above all, by correspondence; ironically, in 1533 he was to censure Holbein for delaying in Antwerp which was preventing Erasmus' mail being delivered (Holbein being the bearer). Here, as in other portraits of him, we see the great master of North European humanism in his self appointed role as educational conscience of the age. In the Web Gallery of Art you can view several portraits of Erasmus by Renaissance painters, such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Dürer and Quentin Massys.",

        "description": "The symbolic gesture whereby Jesus places a wedding ring on the finger of St Catherine of Alexandria caused this altarpiece to be identified for many years as the Mystic marriage of St Catherine. Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the Lübeck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and Lübeck (1491) triptychs. The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives. The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of Flémalle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism. In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years. The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community.",

He painted The Rumanian peasant family, dressed in folk costume, with great care and fine observation, setting them in the magnificent landscape of his native Transylvania.

In 1846, the Pest journal \"Honderû\" reported with great enthusiasm that the picture had been bought by the Hungarian Civilian Guard of Pest for the National Joseph Picture Gallery.

        "description": "The present Madonna with the Serpent is generally called Madonna dei Palafrenieri. It was in late 1605 that Caravaggio finally obtained a commission for St Peter's. The papal grooms or palafrenieri invited him to paint an altarpiece for them, and in April 1606 it was exhibited in the basilica for a few days before being moved to the grooms' church of Sant'Anna nearby. If the sympathy of Paul V had facilitated the commission, his nephew soon profited by it, for later in the year, just after the painter had left Rome for good, it was added to the Borghese collection. Under the watchful gaze of St Anne, Jesus's apocryphal grandmother, Mary helps a naked Christ Child to tread on a snake. The snake may be interpreted as Satan and indirectly as heresy, for Mary and Jesus are free of sin and its consequences, Mary as a virgin mother and by reason of her Immaculate Conception, Jesus as God made man - and they combine to crush the serpent under their feet. This large iconographic canvas has a certain humanity thanks to Mary's naturalness and the lack of inhibition with which Caravaggio depicts Christ naked (a fact that gave offence to some connoisseurs at the time, according to Bellori). Though their haloes are aligned, a dark gulf separates the pretty Mary from her ugly mother; and if the palafrenieri were willing to let Cardinal Scipione Borghese buy the picture so soon after they had received it and paid for it, it may have been because they disliked the unflattering depiction of their patroness.",

The rapidly applied colour on the veil, where the paint has been modelled by brush strokes while still wet, shows Raphael using his materials much more freely than in his earlier panel paintings. The two figures are conceived as a single group, and this fact dominates the scene's visual impact. The only natural elements are a small strip of landscape and the light blue sky in the background. The Madonna's swollen mantle is meant to indicate movement. The extreme synthesis of the colour fields indicates Raphael's idealization of the subject. But the painter's need for formal beauty and the emotional reality of the subject matter are reconciled above all through the tender relationship between Mother and Child. This panel, which critics place in the year 1508, is included among the works executed after Raphael's contact with Florentine art.",

The conditions in Florence were by then very different, because Leonardo had returned from Milan and Michelangelo, after a successful five-year stay in Rome, was also  in the city. Filippino rose to the occasion and produced his most engaging work in the fresco. Opting for large format scenes rather than the relatively constricting system that he faced in the Brancacci Chapel, for example, he filled the space with a nearly surrealistic collection of real and invented imagery. Even in their chronology, the dramatic frescoes in the Strozzi Chapel mark the end of an era. The balance and harmony upon which all of Florentine Humanism had been centred were now broken. The rhetorical gestures, the charged expressions, the unreal colours, but above all the ambiguity between architecture and figures, already belonged to a new age. The calm certainties of the 15th century were disappearing, giving way to the more troubled, questioning details common during the 16th century. The eccentric altar in the painting deserves a note to itself. At the foot of the altar steps crouches the dragon that the saint is exorcising. The composed and measured  perspectives that Tuscan painters preferred almost to the end of the 15th century, their regular architecture and classical rhythm are here abandoned in favour of an eclectic and deliberately confused rag-bag of architectural motifs. These are bizarrely interwoven in a way that breaks every rule. The overall effect is one of instability that also infects the groups of characters. There is a sense of unending clash between sculpture, reliefs, votive offerings, coloured statues, and lifelike details. We are seeing nothing less than the air of tension that followed the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent.",

The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged \"the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting\" (Berti).

The greatest Netherlandish artist of the period is not found among the adherents of the New Style but among those who, like Grunewald in Germany, refused to be drawn into the modern movement from the South. In the Dutch town of 's-Hertogenbosch there lived such a painter, who was called Hieronymous Bosch. Very little is known about him. We do not know how old he was when he died in 1516, but he must have been active for a considerable time since he became an independent master in 1486. Like Grunewald, Bosch showed that the traditions and achievements of painting which had been developed to represent reality most convincingly could be turned round, as it were, to give us an equally plausible picture of things no human eye had seen. He became famous for his terrifying representations of the powers of evil. Perhaps it is no accident that the gloomy King Philip II of Spain, later in the century, had a special predilection for this artist, who was so much concerned with man's wickedness. These two pictures show two wings from one of Bosch's triptychs Philip bought and which is therefore still in Spain. On the left we watch evil invading the world. The creation of Eve is followed by the temptation of Adam and both are driven out of Paradise, while high above in the sky we see the fall of the rebellious angels, who are hurled from heaven as a swarm of repulsive insects. On the other wing we are shown a vision of hell. There we see horror piled upon horror, fires and torments and all manner of fearful demons, half animal, half human or half machine, who plague and punish the poor sinful souls for all eternity. For the first and perhaps for the only time, an artist had succeeded in giving concrete and tangible shape to the fears that had haunted the minds of man in the Middle Ages. It was an achievement which was perhaps only possible at this very moment, when the old ideas were still vigorous and yet the modern spirit had provided the artist with methods of representing what he saw. Perhaps Hieronymus Bosch could have written on one of his paintings of hell what Jan van Eyck wrote on his peaceful scene of the Arnolfinis' betrothal: 'I was there'.",

From the seventeenth century there have been uncertainties about the gender of the singer. Baglione and the Del Monte inventory call him a boy; Bellori, who knew only a copy, calls him a girl. There are reasons for this confusion. One is the Renaissance fascination with androgyny - the singer is not much older than Shakespeare's Rosalind, who renamed herself Ganymede, and Viola, who renamed herself Cesario - and another is the Italian fashion for castrati. The lutanist, with parted lips, sings of love from the madrigal Voi sapete ch ['io v'amo] (you know that [I love you]) by the Flemish composer Arcadelt. In front of him are a violin and bow which invite the spectator to take part in a duet with him; the fruit and the vegetables, and indeed the music itself, imply the harmony that should exist between lovers. Among the early works this painting must count as a virtuoso performance. The glass carafe and its flowers are painted with assured mastery, and Caravaggio is also aware of the problems of perspective that lutes and violins could cause; and he spotlights the the solo player and his instruments so as to make them the main focus of attention, the carafe of flowers so that they are a secondary focus. One of his most talented followers, Orazio Gentileschi, was to paint a girl lutanist with a more beguiling sense of poetry, but without the sense of immediacy that was the hallmark of his master's craft.",

He spent most of his life in the Palazzo Pitti. He was a very popular character during Cosimo I's rule; he was famous and well-liked because of his sharp, witty tongue. Bronzino painted full-length nude portrait of him, with the front on one side, and the back on the other side of the same canvas. The canvas portrays the dwarf as a \"fowler\", or bird-catcher, as he was not allowed to hunt larger animals, this being an activity reserved for characters of higher ranks. The character is portrayed respectively from the front and back at two subequent moments of the action: at the front we see him before the hunt, holding an owl in a snare to be used as a bait to capture a jay that is flying in the air. Two scarce swallowtail butterflies cover his genitals. From behind, we see him just about to turn towards the viewer, eager to proudly show off his prey. During the 19th century, Bronzino's painting was heavily restored, which turned the dwarf into the god Bacchus. The original appearance of the canvas was restored in 2010.",

The masterpiece in this genre is found in the convent church of San Paolo Converso in Milan. The long hall of the church is divided by a wall into an area for the laity in front and one for the nuns in the back. In the vault of the nuns' church Antonio and Vincenzo Campi depicted the Assumption of the Virgin in 1586-88, and Vincenzo painted the Ascension of Christ in the lay church in 1588. In each case the vault is united into a single large illusionistic architectural structure that opens through a shaft in the centre onto the heavens and the apotheosis of Christ or of Mary. Along the spring line of the vault there is a series of painted arches, offering places for the apostles as witnesses. The actual, simple room of the church in which viewers stand is enriched and made more splendid by this fictive architecture and is connected to the world in heaven by these illusionistic stages. The church is transformed into a holy site of divine epiphany thanks to the compelling power of the optical illusion. The centring the whole room on a single, dominant vision of heaven had countless successors in Baroque ceiling decoration.",

From 1549 he was responsible for the continuation of constructing and furbishing the family palace in Bologna. In the palace, Poggi had the halls of the piano nobile painted by Niccolò dell'Abate, Prospero Fontana, and others. They painted friezes with landscapes and grotesques, as well as numerous episodes from the Old Testament. In the ground floor, the twenty-three-year-old Pellegrino Tibaldi created the Odysseus frescoes, a major work that he would never again equal, one which even Annibale Carracci would decisively fall back upon as a model at the end of the sixteenth century. Tibaldi's frescoes, depicting the Adventures of Odysseus, were created in 1550-51. Poggi must have been satisfied with the decoration, since shortly thereafter he also commissioned the artist to paint his newly built family chapel in Bologna's San Giacomo Maggiore. Tibaldi adorned the chapel with scenes from the life of Poggi's name saint, John the Baptist. The Odysseus frescoes adorn the vaults of two rooms. From the entry corridor of the palace one walks first into a large hall (Sala di Ulisse), where the cycle begins. One finds the continuation and conclusion in a smaller room directly adjoining the hall (Stanza di Ulisse). The ceiling articulation and the arrangement of the paintings in both rooms are oriented along the lines of a famous Roman model, Raphael's Logge in the Vatican Palace. The scenes are inserted as 'quadri riportati' (framed paintings that are seen in a normal perspective and painted into a fresco). Between the fields of the painted histories, illusionistic views open onto colonnades that seem to reach up to the heaven. The framings are executed in stucco. With their various decorative systems, each of the two rooms achieves a wholly individual character, one corresponding to its respective size and position. The ceiling in the Sala di Ulisse contains five scenes from the Adventures of Odysseus, namely  1. Blinding of Polyphemus  2. Polyphemus and the Flight of the Greeks  3. Aelos Gives Odysseus the Bag of Winds  4. Neptune and the Ship of Odysseus  5. Odysseus and Circe",

Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme, used previously by Bruegel's Antwerp contemporary, Pieter Aertsen. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of Mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them. Standing on a small hill in the foreground, the grieving friends of Christ are separated from the teeming detail of this scene, with Christ carrying the cross at its centre, and are thus brought closer to the viewer. The style of their depiction, going back to Rogier van der Weyden's paintings, also removes them from the more contemporary representation of the crowd. St John and the saint on the right (and the two mourners a little further back) originated in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), which Bruegel can have known only from copies, since the painting itself had been taken to Spain around the middle of the 16th century. In the background, we can make out a Flemish Jerusalem on the left and the hill of Calvary on the right, with a rock and windmill of unknown significance between them.",

Each of the other predella panels measures 50 x 38,5 cm. The textual sources for The Marriage of the Virgin are the apocryphal Book of James (or Protoevangelicum), known as the Infancy Gospel, 8-9, or, alternatively, The Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine. According to these sources, each of the suitors for the hand of the Virgin brought a rod to the Temple to be placed on the altar. Of these it is Joseph's rod that flowers and onto which the Holy Spirit descends, thus indicating that he has been chosen to marry the Virgin. In Daddi's panel the dove can be seen perched on the top of Joseph's rod while the disappointed suitors break their rods over their knees as the marriage takes place.",

        "description": "The half length figure of the Virgin, with the Child supported by her right arm, is shown within the three-dimensional representation of a window-frame. It was due to the influence of Sienese painting that this Byzantine type of picture found its way to the North. In the Burgundian (and French) painting this is the very first half figure representation of the Madonna and as such has remained unique for many years. This small picture (which is only as big as a Book of Hours) may have stood on the altar of a domestic chapel or on a prie-dieu in the corner of a room. The motif of the window-frame provides the reason why the Virgin is represented as a half length figure. In this way the Madonna comes close to the praying person, but, at the same time, the frame emphasizes the majesty of the Mother of God. (Because rulers generally appeared at a window to show themselves to the people, the window became a symbol of royalty.) The painter may have had in mind the medieval hymns in which the Virgin was praised as \"the Window of Heaven\" (fenestra coeli), as it was through her that the Lord endowed the world with genuine light. The Child's delicate body is also depicted from the waist upwards, emerging from Mary's wide and velvety soft cloak.

The two figures are almost fused together by love, and yet are surrounded by a melancholy mood, the austere premonition of the Passion. The Virgin is absorbed in her thoughts, the Child opens His big, round eyes and looks at the spectator. His forefinger may enjoin silence upon the approaching worshipper.

None of them is documented, although some of them are signed. The most typical and one of the best preserved of them is the so-called Dream of Joseph at Nantes, which in many respects forms a microcosm of La Tour's art and the problems which surround it, in terms of both history and the interpretation of the subject. As recently as 1913 it was attributed to Rembrandt, although the picture was clearly signed La Tour in the top right-hand corner. It is interesting that an illustrious name should have been sought for so magical a picture, and the subject, even now, is as elusive as was the former difficulty of attribution. A youth in biblical costume is making a beckoning or announcing gesture before an old man who has fallen asleep reading a book. The traditional interpretation is that it is a Dream of Joseph, even though Joseph is normally shown as a carpenter (as he is in La Tour's Louvre picture). The youth is hardly the angel Gabriel either, coming to warn Joseph to flee to Egypt in order to escape the impending massacre of all children in Bethlehem by Herod's soldiers. A possible explanation for this enigmatic picture is that it depicts the moment when the young Samuel, having been, he thinks, summoned by the elderly priest Eli, finds him asleep. This surprises Samuel, who at that instant realizes that it is God's voice calling him. If this interpretation of the subject is correct, La Tour has with characteristic subtlety and understatement shown the exact moment when the youth Samuel arrives before the sleeping old man, with a 'here I am' gesture. Samuel's pose is unforgettable. All attempts at the naturalism with which La Tour is so wrongly credited have been abandoned, leaving a Mannerist twisting of the fingers and the caprice of shielding most of the candle flame. Above all, there is an exquisite stillness, which pervades not only this picture but also the other all-too-few masterpieces from this period.",

When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grèz-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods. In his first summer working at Grèz, Nordström was totally under the influence of the seventh Impressionist exhibition. A Clearing in the Woods at Grèz does not seem fully committed to Impressionist technique,though; the filigree of the slender tree trunks retains a linear clarity. The leafage and ground, on the other hand, are a shimmering fabric of green, blue and ochre brush strokes such as might satisfy even the most orthodox Impressionists. The female figure near the point where the path vanishes may seem to have been positioned by chance, but in fact she has her specific spatial and narrative part to play in the overall composition.",

It is primarily in this section of the fresco cycle that Signorelli has given free rein to his inventive genius. An inventiveness that, as Berenson said, made him one of the greatest of modern illustrators, and thanks to which his art is still an extremely important part of our figurative heritage. Despite the rhetorical devices, the theatrical ruses and the occasional contrived details, despite the limitations in his draughtsmanship and use of colour recognized by all modern critics, there is no denying that never before in Italian art had figurative ideas of such unforgettable power been used. Viewed all together the huge frescoes in the Orvieto chapel give an impression of overcrowding and of confusion which is far from pleasing. We have to isolate the individual details in order to grasp the greatness of Signorelli the 'illustrator' and the 'inventor' and therefore justify Berenson's statement. Signorelli's fresco cycle in Orvieto is full of humour, grotesque inventions, erotic allusions and ribald jokes. There is no need to refer to the profane spirit of the Renaissance to explain this. On the contrary, these scenes fit in very well with the idea of the Cathedral as theatrum mundi, as the mirror image of the whole universe, and they are fully in the spirit of the religious plays of the time. Basically, neither Signorelli nor his patrons wanted to do without the enjoyment provided by story-telling, a typically Italian style based on humorous and imaginative details. But this in no way invalidates the dogmatic truth of the prophecies relating to the end of the world, which, especially in those turbulent years, really came across as a terrifying threat. It becomes quite understandable that Michelangelo would have been really interested in these Orvieto frescoes. But he in no way imitated Luca's work , (as Vasari would have us believe), for the spirituality and the moral content of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel have absolutely nothing in common with the theatrical representation in Orvieto. Michelangelo perhaps found in Signorelli's frescoes a useful iconographical repertory, a catalogue of surprising and unusual inventions. In any case the parts of the fresco cycle that would have attracted Michelangelo's curiosity most would certainly have been the scenes with devils and other imaginary figures, those scenes that were best suited to Signorelli's eccentric temperament, to his irony and macabre humour.",

            "3": "Despite the rhetorical devices, the theatrical ruses and the occasional contrived details, despite the limitations in his draughtsmanship and use of colour recognized by all modern critics, there is no denying that never before in Italian art had figurative ideas of such unforgettable power been used.",
            "4": "Viewed all together the huge frescoes in the Orvieto chapel give an impression of overcrowding and of confusion which is far from pleasing.",
            "5": "We have to isolate the individual details in order to grasp the greatness of Signorelli the 'illustrator' and the 'inventor' and therefore justify Berenson's statement.",
            "6": "Signorelli's fresco cycle in Orvieto is full of humour, grotesque inventions, erotic allusions and ribald jokes.",
            "7": "There is no need to refer to the profane spirit of the Renaissance to explain this.",
            "8": "On the contrary, these scenes fit in very well with the idea of the Cathedral as theatrum mundi, as the mirror image of the whole universe, and they are fully in the spirit of the religious plays of the time.",
            "9": "Basically, neither Signorelli nor his patrons wanted to do without the enjoyment provided by story-telling, a typically Italian style based on humorous and imaginative details.",
            "10": "But this in no way invalidates the dogmatic truth of the prophecies relating to the end of the world, which, especially in those turbulent years, really came across as a terrifying threat.",
            "11": "It becomes quite understandable that Michelangelo would have been really interested in these Orvieto frescoes.",
            "12": "But he in no way imitated Luca's work , (as Vasari would have us believe), for the spirituality and the moral content of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel have absolutely nothing in common with the theatrical representation in Orvieto.",
            "13": "Michelangelo perhaps found in Signorelli's frescoes a useful iconographical repertory, a catalogue of surprising and unusual inventions.",
            "14": "In any case the parts of the fresco cycle that would have attracted Michelangelo's curiosity most would certainly have been the scenes with devils and other imaginary figures, those scenes that were best suited to Signorelli's eccentric temperament, to his irony and macabre humour."

In the Biblical account, Jacob is dispatched to the hometown of Laban - the brother of his mother Rebekah - to avoid being killed by his brother Esau, and to find a wife. Out by the well, he encounters Laban's younger daughter Rachel tending her father's sheep, and decides to marry her. Laban is willing to give Rachel's hand to Jacob as long as he works seven years for her. On the wedding night, however, Laban switches Leah for Rachel. Later Laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one. Laban offers to give Rachel to Jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work. Jacob accepts the offer and marries Rachel after the week-long celebration of his marriage to Leah.",

The Penitent Magdalen was painted for the church of Santa Maria Maddalena delle Convertite in Rome's Via del Corso. The church was damaged by fire in January 1617 and rebuilt during the pontificate of Paul V (1605—21) under the patronage of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini (who may have also commissioned the painting). The artist depicted the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the angels in front of Christ's empty sepulcher as narrated in the Gospel of John (20:11-15). The painting is striking for its classical, almost statuesque figures, its dense tonal values, and the clever chiaroscuro play of the splendid landscape and sky. The monumental figure's almost heroic aspect is underlined by the skillfully painted drapery and commanding pose which dominate the picture plane. Guercino emphasizes the clasped hands of the kneeling saint, whose face is contorted in sorrow as she leans against the closed tomb - empty now that Christ has risen. The Magdalen's gaze is directed towards the large nail held by an angel at the right. Guercino's presence in the Eternal City, although brief in time since he had already returned to Cento by 1625, deeply affected local culture, dominated and divided as it was in those days by the endless conflict between classicism and realism. Its location in the center of the city made the painting very accessible and much admired by numerous artists, clearly influencing Pier Francesco Mola and inspiring a drawing by Van Dyck.",

There are incidents of utter brutality, as when a soldier near the throne jabs his dagger into the throat of another, or of pathos, as we watch the dying figure below the rearing horse.

Like the Galatea and the Stufetta, this cycle reflects the cultured atmosphere which flourished in Rome under Julius II and Leo X. The frescoes represent the Story of Psyche, a myth derived from the Golden Ass of Apuleius (2nd century A. D.). According to his commission Raphael was to decorate the large entrance loggia, which communicates between the living-room and garden outside. Raphael approached the highly individual character of the space by treating the roofed building, which is in fact part of the main building, as an open pergola. He developed its structure out of the existing wall divisions, and covered them with magnificent, rampant garlands of fruit. Treating the room as a pergola, he designed the two large ceiling pictures that simulate tapestries stretched across the roof. These huge awnings were painted so ingeniously that we can see the straps holding them in place and the scalloped edges they create by stretching the material. The cycle of pictures appears only on the ceiling. Raphael designed a view out onto a brilliant blue sky, in which half-naked figures - either hovering or standing on clouds - merge into an erotically charged scene. The simulated tapestries depict two scenes: the gods deciding to subject Psyche to various tests, and Psyche holding a magnificent banquet to celebrate her acceptance into the circle of the Immortals. Both scenes were no doubt meant to impress upon guests the cultural attainments of the household. Despite a strong erotic charge, the cycle was meant as an example of virtuous womanhood. Although the preparatory drawings and the general conception of the stories are by Raphael, the bulk of the painting was carried out by his pupils, notably Giovanni da Udine (who painted the rich plant festoons of the frame) with the collaboration of Giulio Romano, Raffaellino del Colle and Gianfrancesco Penni. Pope Leo X liked Giovanni da Udine's garlands so much that he commissioned the painter to decorate the first floor of the loggia in the Vatican with similar floral motifs.",

The traditional vault decoration of the fifteenth century was still a painted blue firmament, it might have evangelists, church fathers, prophets, sibyls, or saints, enthroned or merely floating. In the Sistine Chapel in 1508-12, Michelangelo painted illusionistic architecture filled with figures to serve as the frame for a cycle of biblical stories. This innovation did not find many followers at first.

Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments. The largest room of these apartments, the great hall today called the Sala Paolina after the pope who commissioned it, surprises the visitor with its festive exuberance. Most important is the impression of the whole which presents itself to the eye and aims to overpower visitors to the room with the sheer display of riches, splendour, and bounty. This impression is the  result of the decorative system designed by Perino del Vaga. The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with \"living\" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings. The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III). Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault.",

        "description": "A direct comparison between two artists is made startlingly clear by the two Presentations at the Temple, executed by Giovanni Bellini and by Andrea Mantegna. The two paintings, now housed respectively at the Galleria Querini Stampalia in Venice and the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, have an identical structure and the same characters: in the foreground, leaning against a marble ledge, the Virgin is holding the swaddled Child while the old priest stretches out to take it. At sides and in the centre are several characters identified as Jacopo Bellini (the old man in the middle) and as Nicolosia and Andrea Mantegna, possibly recently married (the young couple standing at the sides facing left). In the painting by Bellini there are two more figures, identified by critics as the mother Anna and Giovanni himself. The invention was probably Mantegna's, as can be assumed from the inflexibly austere framing of the scene, the Child of Donatellian inspiration which placed on the ledge becomes a unit of measure for the scene's spatial depth, and even the physical features of the priest, resembling Squarcione's prototypes which had been familiar to Mantegna. Mantegna's Presentation is enclosed ineluctably within a square frame, a screen separating the group from the spectator; the figures are absorbed in an incisiveness that renders them detached and eternal in an absolute vision. In contrast with its architectural solidity and marmoreal rigour, Bellini's scene has a quite different rhythm, with modifications that are apparently insignificant but in reality substantial: the addition of two characters gives the group more life, splits it up and reassembles it into a small human crowd. The elimination of the frame, or rather its reduction to a pale, marbled shelf, somewhat akin to a church altar-top, suddenly removes every barrier and draws one toward the scene with a sense of intimacy. To the solid as rock colours of Mantegna, who blends flesh-tones, stones and drapery, he responds with a pure and orchestrated play of whites and reds in clear alternation. The views of critics about when the two works were painted do not concur, but it seems impossible to imagine that a long period of time separated their respective execution, as had been initially suggested, also by virtue of the diverse opinions regarding the precedence of the conception. It would be illuminating perhaps to discover the reasons that led to their execution, which do not appear to be a matter of chance, but almost certainly linked to family events, which with this important family portrait were solemnized.",

        "description": "The following scenes are depicted in the painting. 1. Entry into Jerusalem (left side)  Having taken leave of his mother (she stands on the far left with Mary Magdalene), Christ rides a donkey towards the gate of the city, followed on foot by the Apostles. The people cut off palm branches and take off their cloaks, which they spread out on the ground. A man, his knees half-bent, doffs his cap. This pose is a standard one for its time, and appears particularly frequently in Van der Goes. 2. Christ Drives the Money-Lenders from the Temple (left side)  3. Judas with the High Priests (left side) This scene takes place diagonally below the previous one in a chapel-like space lit by torches. Judas is seen amongst the Pharisees who have given him a purse of money in return for his betrayal of Christ. 4. Last Supper (left side) The moment depicted is that where John, his head on his master's chest, asks the name of the traitor, to which Christ responds by placing a piece of bread in Judas' mouth, whereupon Judas leaves. 5. Prayer in the Garden (left side)  6. Arrest of Christ (left side) Judas kisses Christ to identify him to the soldiers and Peter cuts off Malchus' ear. The action takes place in the dark. The soldiers emerge with torches from an archway lower down. A peacock sits on the city wall. The symbolism of this bird probably does not relate to the scene to its left but to the overall iconography of the Redemption and Rebirth. 7. Denial of Peter (left side) Peter can be made out in a small side building, together with a glimpse of Caiaphas' maid, who has recognised him. The cock is shown above between the statues of Adam and Eve, who function as symbols of human weakness. 8. Christ before Pilate (middle)  Pilate, seated on his throne and assisted by two high officials, interrogates Christ. The man on the left will accompany him to Golgotha. The figure on the right is the one who paid Judas in the earlier scene. Pilate's wife touches his shoulder and urges him to be cautious. A young servant holds the basin of water in which Pilate will later wash his hands. A sculpted portrayal of the Judgment of Solomon appears above as a contrast to the cowardly jjudgment of Pilate. 9. Flagellation (middle)  On either side of the arched opening stand white stone sculptures of bearded, naked men, one with a jawbone in his hand, the other with a bow and arrow. No satisfactory explanation has yet been offered for these figures. The arch itself is decorated with a vine motif between two snails. 10. Second Interrogation by Pilate (right side) This scene takes place to the right of the Ecce Homo in a narrow little building set further back. It is clearly intended to depict Christ (with an aureole) appearing before Pilate. This is the episode in which Christ is brought before the Roman governor once again after his flagellation, when he confirms that he is the King of the Jews. It immediately precedes the Crowning with Thorns. In spatial terms, therefore, this secondary scene has been pulled out of sequence. 11. Crowning with Thorns (middle)  12. Ecce Homo (middle)  Herod, with his wife behind him in the shadows, shows Christ to the people who, by their gestures, condemn him to crucifixion. 13. Making of the Cross (middle) As Christ's torture proceeds, two joiners construct the Cross. Their tools comprise a long hatchet, a large and a small drill and a wooden hammer. 14. Carrying of the Cross (right side) A long procession departs from the city gate. John, Mary and two Holy Women follow Christ, who falls to his knees and looks at the viewer. He is preceded by the two thieves. A dog sniffs around to the lower left. 15. Nailing to the Cross (right side) Amongst those present we recognise Pilate and his acolyte. The compositional type of this scene is rather rare for the art of its period, but does feature frequently in prints. In both cases, Germany appears to have provided most examples. 16. Crucifixion (middle) To the left of the Cross we see the blind Longinus, whose sight is restored, and to the right the converted centurion. At the bottom of the scene Herod and his companion ride back down the mountain. Below them and to the left we see a monkey, a symbol of the devil, which Memling used repeatedly. 17. Deposition (right side) The type is clearly inspired by the large triptych by the Master of Flémalle that was located in St James' Church in Bruges, a fragment of which survives in Frankfurt (Städelsches Kunstinstitut). 18. Entombment (right side)  19. Christ in Limbo (right side)  20. Resurrection (right side)  21. Noli me tangere (right side)  22. Men of Emmaus (right side)  23. Christ Appearing by the Sea of Galilee (right side)",

        "description": "Born in Oudenaerde in Belgium, Adriaen Brouwer studied painting in Amsterdam, then Haarlem, where he came into contact with members of local rhetorical chambers, before settling in Antwerp. Admitted as a free master to the painters' guild in 1632, he also became a member of the rhetorical chamber associated with it. He was popular with his Antwerp colleagues who repurchased his freedom - perhaps by acquiring certain of his paintings when he was imprisoned for debt. Adriaen Brouwer specialised in depicting characters on the edge of society spending their time in licentious activities such as card-playing or alcohol and tobacco abuse. This debauched behaviour was looked down on by the members of bourgeois society who saw in it the confirmation of their own moral superiority. During his brief career Brouwer produced only a few dozen works, but revolutionised genre painting with his original synthesis between village scenes with a Bruegelian inspiration and Haarlem genre painting. His great pictorial mastery aroused the admiration of his peers, and painters and collectors like Rubens and Rembrandt owned several of his pictures. Under the influence of early biographers, who attempted to draw parallels between the author's work and his life, experts have sought to see in the background of the Seated Drinkers the wall of Antwerp citadel, then a jail, where the painter was imprisoned. This is, however, unlikely: the artist represented this type of rudimentary landscape several times over, with no link between the subject matter and his time behind bars. On the other hand, the finesse of this finely tempered little masterpiece has been rightly recognised from the outset. Here Brouwer has reached his full maturity. A few delicate red and yellow highlights are enough to enliven a composition largely dominated by subtly gradated browns and greys. If one needed to make a comparison between the painter's life and his work, it would be between the artist's untiring interest for theatre life and the very convincing way in which he succeeds in translating the psychological interplay of the figures.",

The altarpiece occupies a privileged position in the church, because the main altar area is raised above the level of the nave, and a special window was opened to increase the amount of light on the picture. The design of the elaborate gilt wood frame is probably based upon Donatello's high altar for the Paduan church dedicated to Saint Anthony, which, however, included bronze statues and reliefs rather than paintings. At the base are three large, nearly square predella scenes. These panels are copies, the originals were taken by Napoleon and are now in French museums. The painting is an early masterpiece of the young Mantegna. Although the basic format of the painting is essentially that of the late Gothic polyptychs it nevertheless breaks new grounds in the way this traditional scheme is handled. The stage upon which the holy gathering takes place is set against an \"open air\" background. The garlands suspended from the proscenium which appear to thread between the simulated columns of the painting and the actual wooden ones of the frame, dissolve the idea of the fourth wall of the traditional perspective box. The spacial games of this painting have come a long way from Brunelleschi's method of projecting the painted image onto an ideal plane. Perspective has now become a sophisticated means of achieving concrete reality.",

These pictures are not just still-lifes, however much the iconography is reminiscent of the allegorical use of motifs in seventeenth-century Dutch still-life. The flame of a candle, for instance, is a commonplace in these, symbolizing light and life. But these paintings are also oblique portraits. On Gauguin's chair van Gogh has placed two books, recognizable from the colour of their covers as contemporary French novels. On his own chair he has placed a pipe and a tobacco pouch, and in the background there are sprouting onions. Gauguin's Chair is a night scene; his own, a daylight scene. There is a further level of connotation in this pair of paintings. In 1883 van Gogh told his brother of a story he had read about the English novelist Charles Dickens and the illustrator Luke Fildes. When Dickens died Fildes made a drawing which was reproduced in The Graphic, an illustrated periodical whose engravings van Gogh collected. The drawing showed Dickens's workroom and now empty chair. Van Gogh explained to his brother what this image signified for him. He saw it as a symbol of the loss, through death, of the great pioneers of literature and graphic illustration. Moreover these men - especially the illustrators, who had created images to accompany and illustrate modern literature - had, so van Gogh believed, worked in a collaborative and communal spirit. Their artistic community and shared endeavours provided van Gogh with a model for his own dream of a new co-operative society of artists, based on the Studio of the South, which had been initiated by Gauguin's arrival in Arles.",

The artist and the subject was identified on the basis of a number of correspondences, including the year, the man's age, the inscription with his name, the fact that he is attired as a priest, and the very high quality of the painting, which suggests an artist of a stature to match the composer's own. Jacob Obrecht, or Hobrecht as he is generally called in the sources, earned international fame during his lifetime. This is the first portrait of him to come to light. Obrecht was the son of the Ghent city trumpeter Willem Hobrecht. If he was 38 in 1496 (as written on the frame), he must have been born in 1458. The composer Obrecht was appointed choirmaster at Cambrai Cathedral in 1484. Following his dismissal for mismanagement, he was given the corresponding post (succentor) at St Donatian's in Bruges. He was granted six months leave in 1487 to go and work at the court of Ferrara, at the request of Duke Ercole I d'Este. He was subsequently connected with Our Lady's in Antwerp between 1492 and 1496, before being reappointed in Bruges on 31 December 1498. He travelled to the court of Ferrara for a second time in 1504, where he died of plague in 1505. Jacob Obrecht has longish chestnut-brown hair, fairly robust features, and wears a transparent surplice over a brownish toga. The dark green collar with black lining is folded under the surplice on one side, revealing the black collar of the laced-up waistcoat beneath. He has a grey fur almuce about his left wrist, the standard attribute of the canons of a chapter church. He is shown in three-quarter view against a light blue-green background. His name is written in gold, calligraphic letters on either side of his head: Ja[cob] Hobrecht. The reverse features a standing female figure in grisaille, wearing a long dress, and reading from an open book which she holds at waist height. The sitter will originally have been looking towards the figure of a saint or a religious scene. Hinge-marks on the right-hand side of the frame confirm this beyond doubt. It is not certain, however, whether this was the painter's original intention. The date 1496 (two years after Memling's death) appearing on the frame must refer to the later installation or completion by another artist of a diptych or triptych left unfinished. The later addition of the grisaille might also be an indication that the painting was finished after Memling's death.",

By 1670, when this portrait was probably painted, only four of Murillo's nine children were still living. His only daughter had entered a Dominican convent, and his youngest son was deciding on a career in the church; he was later to become a canon of Seville Cathedral. After the artist's death, the painting was engraved in Antwerp at the request of Murillo's friend Nicolas de Omazur, a Flemish poet and silk merchant established in Seville. The portrait itself borrows a device from Netherlandish engravings, much used in the frontispiece of books. A gilded oval frame, set against a wall on a shelf or console table, encloses Murillo's half-length likeness. But in a feat of legerdemain only possible in art, it is the painter himself, not his image, who paradoxically extends his hand beyond the frame. Dressed in sober black, with a soft lace collar at his throat, he looks at the viewer with a dignified and slightly melancholy air. Nothing within this portrait betrays that he is anything other than a gentleman. Around the frame, however, are disposed the tools of his profession: a palette laid out with paint, brushes, a drawing in red chalk, the chalk itself, a pair of dividers and a ruler. The white on the palette is a real, three-dimensional swirl of white lead paint, not the image of one. The dividers and ruler tell us that he is a learned artist, creating pictures according to the rules and proportions of mathematical laws and not merely imitating appearances. A drawing - the academic basis of all the visual arts - recalls that in 1660 Murillo co-founded the Academy of Seville of which he was the first president. As in all his portraits, in contrast to his other pictures, Murillo emphasises truthfulness above charm. Strong light, casting dark shadows, is used to model the forms, and his famous 'soft' brushwork is apparent only in the hair and lace. The sombre colour scheme of black, white and ochre is relieved only by red - as indicated on the palette, where its undiluted presence helps to clarify the spatial construction of the painting and enlivens its solemn play on the art of reality and the reality of art.",

Confectionery made of crystallized sugar, nuts, figs and raisins, some in a costly Chinese bowl and some outside it, represent spiritual principles which are being guarded, as it were, by the green-feathered parrot sitting on the far edge of the bowl. The religious context is further emphasized by the grapes and the wine glass, and indeed by the carnation. From the late Middle Ages onwards theologians saw carnations as a symbol of Christ's death on the cross, because of the nail-shaped form of petals and fruit. Furthermore, the coins at the front are probably another reference to the Passion, reminding us of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.",

One is Venus, with an apple (or an orange, which the infant Jesus also holds sometimes instead of an apple, and which represents desire, so that it has the same metaphorical value), symbol of love and beauty, given to her by Bacchus. The fruit has a multitude of erotic associations and also alludes to the artist's own name (Paris). But she also takes on the allegorical significance of Victory, who usually holds a pomegranate in her right hand and a helm in her left. By this she is, in turn, referring to Mars, disarmed by Cupid, winged boy and the son of Venus, seated on the armor. Mars, according to Aristotle, is rightly linked with Venus, for men of war are strongly inclined to lust. The victorious Venus rests on the stump of a tree. Behind stands a stag, symbol of nobility and courtesy and emblem of the royal house of France. As well as suggesting who may have commissioned the painting, this hints at a connection between Mars and Actaeon, whose attribute is the stag. Its antlers, resembling the branches of a tree, are periodically renewed, symbolizing the continual rebirth of life. Having got this far, we can attempt a more detailed interpretation of the subject, in which, behind the common mythological theme of Mars, Venus, and Cupid, is concealed an 'Allegory of the victory of love (and of beauty) that always overcomes martial vigour,' a subject that could have been dedicated to two people in love or, on the contrary, reflect the world of courtesans, as might seem more likely from the naked breasts, the colour of the dress, and the blond tresses of the woman. It is no surprise that between 1649 and 1652, when the painting is mentioned for the first time in the collection, its subject remained an enigma and was not stated. It is clear that this sensuous mythological fable of extraordinary chromatic richness, full of stylistic preciosities as well as decorative qualities in the sumptuousness and beauty of the fabrics, has connections with the world of chivalry, the refinements of aristocratic courtesy, the works of erotic art, and the exquisite and elegant style of the Mannerists, that are all typical of Fontainebleau. We know that the artist visited the French court, perhaps twice, in 1538/39 during the reign of Francis I and in 1559/60, in the time of Francis II. Recently critics have dated this painting to both the first and the second of these visits. The second is more likely given the highly evolved style of the work.",

        "description": "With the help of central perspective, the artist leads the eye of the spectator from the Ducal Palace, over the Molo to the Fonteghetto della Farina, where the entrance to the Grand Canal is marked by the silhouette of Santa Maria della Salute and the Punta della Dogana. Further to the left, behind a throng of gondolas and other boats, we can see the hazy profile of the Giudecca. Owing to the many figures in the foreground, the canvas seems to transcend the genre of the veduta. The schooner behind the gondolas in the left foreground has just fired a salute. A group of dignitaries crosses the Molo in the direction of the Ducal Palace, among them Procurators recognizable by their red robes. A curious crowd watches the procession; it includes many figures also found in Carlevaris's lively oil studies of daily life in the Serenissima. Carlevaris is not the inventor of this veduta: long before, in the 1660s to be precise, the French artist Israel Silvestre made a print of roughly the same view. The Venetian master is undoubtedly responsible for the sense of grandeur about the scene, achieved by raising the vantage point and adding the panorama on the left. Carlevaris often employed this device - especially to represent diplomatic receptions, for which he was famous - shifting the point of view slightly each time. He situated these events in front of the Ducal Palace, where the newly appointed ambassadors presented their credentials to the Doge and Senate, the climax of a ceremony that lasted altogether several days. The Entry of the Earl of Manchester into the Doge's Palace, which the Earl himself commissioned in 1707, is one of the masters best-known works in this series and also one of his two earliest veduta. The Reception of Cardinal César d'Estrées represents a similar event, so similar, in fact, that until recently this canvas was assumed to be an autograph variant of the English reception. Judging from the staffage, however, it was not a repetition. Unlike the Entry of the Earl of Manchester a French, not an English mission is shown here, witness the fleur-de-lis on the Ambassador's gondolas in the left foreground. Furthermore the composition draws attention to the prelate in the midst of the crowd; since only one French ambassador to Venice held an ecclesiastical office - Cardinal d'Estrées - the reception must be his. César d'Estrées (1628—1714), a bishop of Laon who was created cardinal in 1672, was a seasoned diplomat. In January 1701 he was sent to Mantua and Venice to convince them to deny the imperial army passage to Milan despite their neutrality on the issue of the Spanish succession. D'Estrées' mission proved fruitless inasmuch as the Republic refused to alter its position; in April the prelate left empty-handed for Naples to join the Spanish king. Carlevaris may have received and executed the commission during the three months the Cardinal spent in Venice or shortly thereafter. Though it is still unclear whether Venice or the diplomat himself took the initiative, the latter possibility seems most likely, given the fact that most of Carlevaris's paintings of diplomatic receptions were prompted by the ambassadors involved. The scarcity of information about Carlevaris's work prior to 1703, the year of publication of his famous series of engravings, Le Fabriche, e Vedute di Venetia, accounts for the importance of this painting. A handful of landscapes and several capricci are all that is known of his oeuvre before then. His first documented commission for painted vedute only dates from 1705, while the two earliest, securely dateable works in this category were executed two years later. The Reception of Cardinal d'Estreés is thus probably the first indication of Carlevaris's competence in this genre; more importantly, however, it is arguably the prototype of the eighteenth-century veduta.",

This is the case with the tangled group of Israelites who, in the scene of the Brazen Serpent, writhe in the throes of death, and, above all, with the crucified figure of Haman in the Punishment of Haman. In the irregular field of the pendentive on the left is the story opf Esther, Ahasueras, and Haman. On the right of the pendentive, the king sends Haman to provide royal apparel for Mordecai, who is sitting at the king's door. On the left Esther reveals Haman's plot to Ahasueras. The whole fresco is dramatically dominated, in the central scene, by the punishment of Haman. The daring foreshortening of the body, which literally cuts through the picture plane, is reinforced by by that of the white frame of the door leading into Ahasueras' room. The Old Testament book of Esther describes how a young Jewess interceded with a Persian king to prevent the massacre of her people. For this deed she is still commemorated in the Jewish festival of Purim, when the story is read aloud in the synagogue. It tells of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) of Persia who reigned in the 5th centurt B.C. Having dismissed his queen, Vashti, because she had offended him the king chose Esther to replace her, not knowing that she was Jewish. Esther, an orphan, was 'fair and beautiful' and had been brought up by her cousin, Mordecai. The king's chief minister, Haman, an enemy of the Jews and the personal foe of Mordecai, decreed that all the Jews in the Persian empire should be massacred. Mordecai asked Esther to intercede with the king. To enter the king's presence without being summoned was forbidden on pain of death, even to the queen, but Esther, having dressed in her finest robes, took her courage in both hands and entered the royal chamber. Ahasuerus held out his golden sceptre to signify that he would receive her and Esther swooned with relief. She led up to the matter by first inviting the king to a banquet where, in due course, her intercession on behalf of her people succeeded. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Esther in the act of pleading with the king was regarded by the Church as a prefiguration of the Virgin in her role of intercessor on the Day of Judgment. This became established early on as the central episode of the Esther narrative in Christian art. The more secular theme of the 'Toilet of Esther' gained popularity with artists of the Renaissance and later. Michelangelo's fresco depicts three episodes of the story in the centre with the crucifixion of Haman (instead of the Biblical hanging).",

When the portraits were still together, they passed on from Carl von Waagen to other owners, until it alone was finally acquired by the museums of Berlin in 1977. The various restorations have partially or entirely destroyed areas of the landscape and the inscription on the card at the top; the same holds true for the small statue of the prophet, inserted in the window post, which, from the side, looked toward the other portrait and in whose book Dürer had written his monogram, as Wenzel Hollar's engraving shows. At one time, the two portraits were considered to be two representations of the same person, namely, Katharina Fürleger. The series of letters on the trim of the blouse also seemed to point to this; however, they are probably the initials of a motto. Today, it is generally believed that they are portraits of two younger sisters of the Fürleger family. The portrait, along with its companion-piece, acts as part of a fairly uncommon diptych; it is the representation of the two Fürleger sisters of Nuremberg. In contrast to the other young woman, depicted with loose hair, this one - an eighteen-year-old, according to the inscription - wears her hair in large braids wrapped around her head, a sign that she opted for marriage. Her defiant gaze is also proof of this. Similarly allude the sprigs of sea holly (Eryngium campestre) and Southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum), symbols of conjugal fidelity and eroticism, which she holds in her hand. Note that one of the portraits has a neutral background, while the other has a window with a landscape scene. One interpretation could be that one of the young women renounces the world, while the other welcomes it openly. In both figures, Dürer reveals pathologic symptoms: the young woman with the loose hair has goiter, and the two of them show signs of arthritis in their hands.",

One of the most beautiful examples of such paintings of two figures is Two Men Contemplating the Moon. In this ethereal painting, human and natural symbolism are subtly interwoven. The moon, an old Christian sign of hope, gleams from behind a withered tree, watched by two men, perhaps the artist and a pupil, in the 'old German' costume favoured by the resistance movement during the years of Napoleonic occupation. Painted after this threat had lifted, the picture links past, present and future through the cycles of time and season and the intercession of their human observers. In response to demand from his clientele, Friedrich executed several copies of this composition, a number of which remain in private collection. He took up the motif again, in slightly varied form, in the painting Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon (c. 1824, Nationalgalerie, Berlin), in which he has perhaps portrayed himself and his wife in this scene of Romantic wonderment.",

        "description": "There is an inscription in the top left monogrammed by another hand and dated 1497. This portrait, together with the Portrait of a Young Fürleger with Her Hair Done Up, forms part of a rather uncommon diptych. The coats of arms, added shortly after and placed on the external side beside the portraits, were those of the same family, even though the coats of arms are different: one has a cross between two fish, the other an upside-down lily. The emperor Sigismund had authorized the families of ecclesiastic members to add a cross to their own coats of arms. For this reason, it was deduced that the young woman portrayed with loose hair, the coral bracelet, the hands joined in prayer, and her head bowed down had devoted herself to the cloistered life. The Latin inscription added to the engraving Wenzel Hollar modeled on this painting, also recommended following in the path of Christ. The very fine brushstrokes of this exquisite painting and the sharp distinction between the areas in light and those in shadow give the face a sense of plasticity, endowing it with a particularly vivid expression.

It should be noted that the young woman with the loose hair also rests her arms on a window sill.

Although commissioned for St John's Hospital, it has neither an inscription nor a signature, unlike the St John altarpiece and the Floreins triptych, both of which were ordered for the same institution. This might be explained by the fact that the shrine was not on permanent display, but was shown only on the feast-day of St Ursula. Unlike the paintings, which also focus attention on the donors and the maker, this is a purely liturgical object. Memling's care for detail and constant concern for harmony are part of his predilection for a classical style. These aspects of his art are given their finest expression in the St Ursula Shrine. Memling was commissioned to decorate a new reliquary, to which the saint's remains were to be transferred on 21 October 1489 during a grand ceremony in the chancel of the church of the hospital of St John. (The relics would seem to have previously been kept in a small 14th century chest, which has also survived). The new shrine was made of wood, based on a model in precious metal. It is in the form of a house or chapel, the pack-saddle roof of which is set with painted trompe-l'oeil \"tondi\". The decoration of pinnacles, gables, crockets, finials, interlacing and statuettes in niches, is in the finest flamboyant Gothic style. The six arched openings in the sides take the place of stained glass windows, and recount six episodes from the life of the saint as recorded by Jacques de Voragine in The Golden Legend Ursula was a Breton princess. She agreed to marry Eree, son of the pagan King of England, on the condition that he convert to Christianity. She was subsequently martyred for her faith at the hands of the Huns.",

With their cycle from first bud to death, their response to light, and as manifestations of God's purpose on earth, flowers were for Runge the most revealing of all natural forms. Together with small children and musical instruments they formed the allegorical base of his most ambitious work, a series on the theme of Times of Day. This was intended to take the form of four huge oil paintings, and to be experienced in a Gothic chapel to the music of choirs and poetry by his friend the writer Ludwig Tieck. This grand plan never materialized; the designs were published in some rather unsatisfactory engravings in 1806 and 1807, while only one of the four subjects, Morning, was developed in oil, in two versions (the larger was later cut into fragments, having failed to satisfy the painter himself). The painting represents a supreme statement of the nature mysticism associated with the Romantic movement, and is undoubtedly the masterpiece of Runge's short life. He began work on it in Dresden, where he had been greatly moved by Raphael's Sistine Madonna in the picture gallery, and his tightly structured, vertical compositions have some of the qualities of altarpieces. As in the earlier Nightingale's Lesson, they are surrounded by hieroglyphic borders, combining Christian and mythological symbolism. Individual plants, minutely scrutinized like botanical specimens, are integrated into visionary patterns. In Morning, Runge was able to incorporate his researches into colour theory, based on association and the revelatory power of light. The small version contains a passage of sublimely lovely pure landscape painting — the summer meadow on whose carpet of flowers a baby wakes at dawn.",

        "description": "Antony of Burgundy was the illegitimate son of Philip the Good and Jeanne de Prelle, and fulfilled military and advisory functions at the Court of Burgundy. During the chapter held at The Hague on 2 May 1456 he was admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece, on which occasion he received the golden chain with which he is portrayed. This symbolises the personal bond with Philip the Good, the head and founder of the order of knighthood. Flints, steel and sparks, the emblems of Philip the Good, form the links in the chain. The ram's fleece is taken from the mythological legend of Jason, but refers also to Gideon, God's chosen warrior in the Bible. These are exemplary figures, whose heroic deeds were cultivated by the duke and his courtiers. Antony of Burgundy embodies the old knightly ideal which the Burgundian power wished to be seen to aspire to. Court dignitaries, knights, tournament judges and soldiers are frequently depicted with an arrow, as a symbol of office, a token of special distinction or merit, or as an attribute. The arrow could also refer to a position as king of an archery guild, the winner of the annual shooting tournament. In 1463 Antony of Burgundy was king of the St Sebastian Guild in Bruges. If the projectile refers to this commendable achievement, this makes it one of Rogier van der Weyden's last works. In any event, the picture was painted after 1456, when Antony of Burgundy was admitted into the Order of the Golden Fleece. His hairstyle and the high, conical hat point to the period shortly after 1460. Typical of Rogier van der Weyden's art is the low portrait bust in three-quarter profile against a dark, neutral background. Antony of Burgundy's expression is dignified and serene. The face is individualised, but the traits reflect a pattern of softly-flowing curves. In all likelihood the man's real features have been somewhat simplified to give an overly harmonious and therefore somewhat rigid facial expression, which goes to emphasise the impression of distinction. The painter's workmanship appears in the subtle reproduction of textures, in particular of the skin with the soft gradations of the flesh colours. In short, the artist has modelled the knight on an ideal image, whilst retaining his individuality.",

In the fresco \"... we see the cruelty of those who at Herod's command kill the poor children without pity for their mothers... Many other emotions are also represented, so that no beholder can doubt the excellence of the master\". It is surprising that this horrific event is given an individual monumental scene in the cycle of the life of Mary, and that the normally very popular Annunciation scene is pushed to one side. But the Slaughter of the Innocents provided Ghirlandaio with an opportunity to present a dramatic composition showing a lively crowd scene scenes he had studied in classical models. It was not without reason that he placed a Roman triumphal arch covered with relief of classical battle scenes towering up behind the dramatic events. Once again the background of the picture acts as a backdrop, for the figures are bunched together on a densely packed front stage and are not integrated into architecture. The Slaughter of the Innocents takes place amid a violent swirl of movements and gestures. There is a dramatic confusion of people's and horses' bodies, which fall upon each other all around. Ghirlandaio depicts the classical model for the scene at the top on the arch. The liveliest composition in the artist's entire range of works, this large crowd scene is reminiscent of classical battle reliefs. The mothers of Bethlehem are in a wild panic, trying to save their children from the killers' swords, which are flashing through the air. On the ground lie the mutilated bodies of the slaughtered innocents in pools of blood. In the foreground on the right a desperately screaming mother, her red garment billowing in frantic folds, is tearing at the hair of one of the killers from behind. Pure horror is written on her face. The soldier, dressed in classical armor that has a blue leather body piece shaped to indicated the ribs, is bending right over backwards. The foreground of the picture is characterized by falling horses, bloody limbs and heads, streaming hair and drawn swords. On the far right the fleeing mothers are bunched together, but they will not succeed in escaping Herod's order that all the children of the same age as Christ should be put to the sword.",

The sacra conversazione is placed in a completely Renaissance architectural setting, where the perspective study get perfection with the foreshortening of the floor. The natural light and the absence of gold on the backgrond of the picture, make this altarpiece one of the first achievements of the new Renaissance art. The traditional tricusped frame of Gothic triptychs is transformed in the Magnoli Altarpiece into an elegant loggia decorated with lovely marble intarsia. Sheltered by this construction stands the throne, with the Madonna and Child and four saints. Each one of these characters has his own physical and moral individuality, conveyed not only by the very sculptural relief with which the beautiful faces are drawn, but also by the precise position they hold within the space so clearly defined by the architectural structure. If we compare this painting with the Berlin Adoration of the Magi, painted about five years earlier, we can see how Domenico's palette has changed: the dark and bright colours in the Berlin tondo, a legacy from Gentile and Pisanello, have been replaced by lighter colours and more delicate hues. But what really stands out in the Uffizi altarpiece is the presence of this pale and delicate light coming from a natural source, like an open window with a ray of warm sunlight streaming in, lighting up the peaceful composition and creating a shadow against the background, as evidence of its existence. This particular idea of lighting is Domenico's greatest debt to the art of Fra Angelico, and also one of his most extraordinary and original achievements.",

These included the beautiful, large-format Moonrise by the Sea, which is dated fairly unanimously to around 1821. A contemporary description of the painting says that two men have clambered across the rocks a long way out into the shallows and appear to be waiting for a ship. Their two female companions are seated more in the foreground. Two massive anchors take the place of vegetation, which is here reduced simply to some saltwater plants.",

Pieter van Laer lived in Rome from 1623 to 1639, and the picture in the Budapest collection was painted during the last years of his stay. The free composition of his paintings, the broad gestures and bright sunshine illuminating the colours reveal what most captivated the artist, who had moved south from the grey rainclouds of the Netherland skies. Genre painters often represent some play or game. The simplest social game is the \"morra\" for which no objects are needed because the fingers of the hand suffice. This primitive entertainment has brought together this bunch of penniless, ragged tramps. Laer wilfully apprehended them and their environment in what they are common, trivial and humorous, too unlike the other canvases of the painter. Aristocratic collectors liked such small-size genre pictures, for they considered them funny. A smaller second version of the painting is in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.",

In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right. The Flagellation scene was located at the far right of the middle row of the right wing. It shows the naked Christ bound to a column alluding to the praetorium (judgment hall) of Pontius Pilate where Christ was condemned to death. The crown is unusual for this subject because it is chronologically out of place.",

To the left of the middle distance is the view of a small town with spires, to the right austere mountains. The suffering figure of the Virgin dominates the painting. No longer young, her pallid face is immobile in its grief. Her blue mantle covers her head, revealing a white veil, and spreads out in huge folds to her feet. In a strange pose, the back arched, the body rigid, Christ, a white cloth wrapped across his loins, appears to be floating on her lap. A young St John bends in loving tenderness above him, with the kneeling donor beside St John. On the right the mourning, pitiful figure of St Mary Magdalen completes the diagonal line arching over the Virgin and St John to the donor. The yellow-lined red cloak of the Magdalen extends around her in a great curve. Her left hand holds the vase of ointment, with the right she presses the edge of her cloak to her eye. Its concentrated emotion, dramatic force and religious content make this painting the supreme manifestation in mediaeval art of the tragedy of Christ, only softened by the tender expression on St John's face. The Virgin's sorrow is profound and austere, almost unbending; the Magdalen's is softer, more womanly. This masterpiece has been claimed for many schools, including the Catalan and Portuguese, but it seems almost certain that the painter was the French Charonton. With this work the master enriched French and European painting with one of the finest representations of the Pietà in existence.",
